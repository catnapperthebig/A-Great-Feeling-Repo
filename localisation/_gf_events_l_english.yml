cityfall.13.t:0 "The Fall of Vanhoover"
cityfall.13.d:0 "[This.GetnewspaperHeader]The first of Equestria's major cities has fallen to the Changelings. Vanhoover, a major strategic port for military and trade, was captured after hours of intense urban fighting, featuring inventive river crossing maneuvers, but mostly the usual grinding of teeth as both sides fed soldiers into the conflict. The stand-out moment was when a Changeling formation somehow snuck around the entire Equestrian army and captured a fortified artillery base in the rear and used them to target retreating assets. This caused the Equestrians to divert a huge amount of forces to try and silence the guns, which ended up hastening their defeat.\nEquestrian officers have claimed that a counter-offensive is already in planning, but this is doubtful."

cityfall.14.t:0 "The Second Invasion"
cityfall.14.d:0 "[This.GetnewspaperHeader]Grave news arrived for the Equestrian nation, as the city of Canterlot itself fell to the Changeling army.\nIt was shaping up to be an urban siege to lay low even the hivish Changelings, as the domed magical shield could only be temporarily disabled, leaving storm units trapped inside until it could be reduced again. Under these circumsances, even the local militias were able to keep the attackers at bay. However, the course of the war had left a shantytown of tens of thousands of refugees trapped outside the protected zone, and a fire started as a result of the fighting. Once it was put out by the Changeling army, the acting governor of Canterlot (the true leaders having fled long ago) surrendered, fearing for the safety of the civilians in and around the city."
