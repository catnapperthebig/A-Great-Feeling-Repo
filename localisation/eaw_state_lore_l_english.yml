  state_lore_text_container_state_name_251:0 "The §YDark Tower§!:"
  state_lore_text_container_state_description_251:0 "In the heart of the changeling-dominated regions of Equus lies a city who's ancient roots spell death and destruction for all who oppose its ruler, but who's new growths simply write of progress with the interminable will of the tides. At the center is a colossal construction, a steel-glass spire that reaches to the top of the sky from the peak of a grey mountain, both designs of the city's inhabitants. There you can, at least in theory, visit the Royal Spire after a standoff with security, but in practice non-changelings are barely allowed.\n\nIf you are one of the lucky few, observe the architecture. Brutally efficient, the building is built as a fortress, but the ancient look hides the modernity of the structure.\n\nOutside of the central earthwork hive, there are the new districts, ever-expanding masses of industry and commerce built almost entirely during the last twenty years. The remains of the workers who died to erect an entire metropolis so quickly can be found in the spaces between walls and under streets if you are so inclined, but do not despair, for any of the locals will tell you that nothing is gained without sacrifice, and the raw power of Vesalipolis is testament to that. This city is one of the largest in the world, a far cry from its centuries as a backwater. Like any good Changeling city, it has certain issues: overcrowding, a permanent undercurrent of dissent that occasionally erupts into massed violence, extreme police repression. It swarms and writhes every morning as workers try to walk the packed streets. Everyone has at least one neighbor that recieved a late-night visit from the VOPS, or Security Administration, or Vhy, and they were never seen again - or forced out of their apartment via the window. Few take it seriously. There can be no gain without sacrifice, and the remains can be recycled.\n\nBut for a time, you can take to the skies and look down upon the city. The 'new' expands ever outwards and upwards, but never encroaches upon the central spire. As you look at the beautification initiatives, the colorful banners waving on every street, and maybe one of the many parades or celebrations, you can almost forget that the entire city is designed with 'fashionable architecture' the likes of which will create the nightmares of invading armies. After all, there can be no gain without sacrifice, especially that of your enemies."

  state_lore_text_container_state_name_252:0 "The §YUgly Duckling§!:"
  state_lore_text_container_state_description_252:0 "Before the Century of Hunger, Ditrysium was one of the wealthiest hives. After decades of maneuvering and infiltration into enemy ranks, their natural harbor and wood supplies allowed them to lead massive sea-raids upon the Olenians that could fell entire dynasties in a manner of days, leaving nought but ash, rubble, and bone for whoever came next. Now those days are gone, and they were buried in the Third Prandialist Great Strike, which continues to haunt the city. Regardless, Ditrysium has found a new purpose as the base for the Zehr, the Changeling navy. Endless hulls for transports and war-crafts are created out of fire and sparks in the grand dry-docks, while colossal concrete structures protect the 'Underwaterships' from whatever prying eyes can exist here. New war machines are a cheap novelty up here due to their frequency, and new designs dominate the factories that employ most of the city itself.\n\nThe hive's economics nowadays are concentrated on their submarine fleet, which is one of the better in the world despite being equally new. It is used to conduct nearly all trade via secret intermediaries, and not always with 'sellers' who have choice or knowledge, and through this it brings sanctioned artifacts of the outside world to the nation. The cultural effect of this makes the city viewed as an outsider to the rest, along with their lack of fear of water. Slowly, the hive is changing the composition of its grand fleet to be one that Queen Helvia thinks can destroy that of the hated ponies - or at least give them second thoughts."

  state_lore_text_container_state_name_259:0 "The §YGrand Foundry§!:"
  state_lore_text_container_state_description_259:0 "Throughout most of Changeling history, Vraks has stood as the most consistently dominant military power. This continued into the Unification Wars, where it was the antagonist of the largest conflict against Queen Chrysalis's imperium. Unfortunately for them, Chrysalis's mother had predicted this, and planted the seeds that would bring the hive down with paper and pen. In the final days, Vraks was paralyzed with insufficient technology and intelligence, and thus lost a string of major battles that left it humiliated. The storm of steel and fire is something they consider their specialty, and they look forwards to bringing it to the enemies of their race with all of their new toys.\n\nThe truth of war is that it is an economic endeavor above all, and thus Vraks invested heavily in industry. Chrysalis has encouraged this to continue, resulting in the Vraks Dynastic Mega-Foundry, a region of smokestacks and dark clouds that encompasses a third of the hive's outer developement and has an economic throughput higher than some nations. This complex of interlocking factories and refineries has produced 80% of the nation's cars, 50% of the nation's processed food, 60% of the nation's cloth. It is the reason why the city is permanently covered in a layer of grime, a point of pride alongside the fact that nearly everyone not employed there is in the army. It is also one of the largest publicly-owned companies and privately-owned companies in the world at the same time due to being property of the Royal Dynasty of Vraks, which in theory is inseperable from the state, and in practice is Queen Argynnis.\n\nVraks is the military breadbasket of the nation, and is built like a fortress just as the other hives. At the end of the world, Vraksian armies armed with Vraksian weapons will be there, and build a monument in the hive's Glorious Vault to commemorate it. Such is their way."

  state_lore_text_container_state_name_309:0 "The §YSufferer§!:"
  state_lore_text_container_state_description_309:0 "The hive of Lyctida was once one of the main hives of the Changeling state. During the Unification Wars, it had fallen far: It was the last hive conquered, and it welcomed Queen Chrysalis with open arms at the prospect of restoring the throne's power. Decades of strife with the Prandialists and punitive campaigns by the Olenians, capped with the Third Prandialist Great Strike, had done a number on the hive's population, and at the time of its annexation, the Prandialist-Marksists and "Saturnalians" were rightfully more concerned with each other than with the powerless monarchy. Queen Chrysalis put down the Prandialist-Marksists, and the Saturnalians joined her willingly. Their leader was Dieter Heinrich, and this is where the two met. After the Great Betrayal, Dieter reorganized his militia into the Vhy, and picked the best fighters to create the new Queen's Guard in line with his new role as the captain of the organization.\n\nAlthough Lyctida is far from irrelevant nowadays, it is still one of the less spectacular hives. Its wood industry is its greatest claim to fame, with massive tree-farms that produce some of the strongest wood on the continent in great numbers. More well-known is the 'Vevilsberg Fortress', a fortified hive-castle that makes up the Vhy's moral heart and contains much of its more secret material. The hive of Lyctida is one of the most culturally developed, with a great many festivals of significance and a Royal Center that contains some of the greatest paintings and sculptures in the region's history due to a dynastic appreciation of fine art. That's not to say it's the least miserable hive, as it is also renowned for comedians specializing in the humor of the Changelings, which is so self-depracating and morbid at the same time that no outsiders can understand it."

  state_lore_text_container_state_name_262:0 "The §YSchool§! of §YHorrors§!:"
  state_lore_text_container_state_description_262:0 "Soryth was an anomaly in the Unification Wars. Although the massive stockpiles of magical artifacts under the control of the royal family could have doubtless made an invading army suffer many unforseeable problems, they instead chose to accept servitude, believing that it would grant them more favor. Whether it worked or not is up for debate, but the hive was left untouched until the Thoraxians appeared.\n\nSoryth was an anomaly long before then, too. It is comparatively spread-out, and much of the lake is used by boating teams as extra roadways or as a source of fish. The pile of magical artifacts served as a deterrent to invaders before Chrysalis as well, so the hive center is the smallest and least-developed. With its magic/research-based economy, it is also without the choking black clouds of Vraks's foundry-biome or the permanent sunset of Ditrysium's shipyards. Rather, it has "dark zones" in the southern district, where the city's industrial center is almost entirely focused on utilizing magical lightning. Such massive thaumatic output turns the sky a starless black if you are standing too close, and exposure to the arcs themselves can render you permanently blind, but the quality of cuts and welds is unheard of elsewhere, creating a sort of artisinal heavy industry sector. Much is also made of the magical properties of the lake and the nearby mountains, which both provide for the research potential.\n\nThe dark side of this particular hive is the same thing that made it different. It's unknown what powers exactly the leadership has access to, but they think it is enough to let them go behind the back of their new matron whenever they feel like, usually to satisfy some curiousity or acquire yet more relics."
