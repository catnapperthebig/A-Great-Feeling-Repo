 EAW_WS_CHN:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] - The Shapeshifters"
 EAW_WS_CHN_desc:0 "Mountains alight with a thousand internal fires. Black tendrils of sky-gods reaching into the smokestacks of the massive foundry-regions. Implacable alien creatures stacking by the millions under skies of stone and concrete, each one with an icy, all-consuming hunger at their core. This is the §YChangeling Lands§!.\n\nThe population are black-shelled insectoids, a cruel parody of the pony form. They are the name of their country, and they earned the title with their ability to take the form of any other creature, down to the size and voice. This ability is so that they can get close and drain them of love, the less tangible and bloody of the changeling’s two food requirements. For ever, they have lived in §Yhives§! under all-powerful §YQueens§!, who organize them into ravenous swarms that consume all in their path and destroy what remains.\n\nIt is lucky that their territory is always larger than they can support, and internal strife has kept them from conquering everything. Now, however, the tragic dividend is appearing.\n\nIn the 890’s, a new form of hive was created. It was the §RPrandialists§!, revolutionaries who warred against the Queens and proposed an §Renforced egalitarianism§! within the biological castes. They were supported by §REquestria§!, but the monster that the ponies gestated soon bit the hoof that fed them. Thousands of Olenians lay dead in their fields when the Prandialists expanded beyond the race’s borders, and the final chapter in a history of raids and pillaging was written. The changeling’s neighbors became too able to repel even the biggest incursions, and no individual hive could campaign for food without inviting sure destruction. Thus began the §RCentury of Starvation§!.\n\nIt was in this world that one Queen would begin to lay foundations from her throne in §GVesalipolis§!, the central hive, which was most able to sustain famine conditions due to experience. On the day of her death under suspicious circumstances, §GQueen Chrysalis§! took her place. She would, in a whirlwind series of campaigns and diplomatic actions, unite the §GChangeling Lands§! under her own banner, finishing in §Y980§!. From there, she would look outwards in order to end the shortage of love.\n\nThis is where a strange persona appears. §ODieter Heinrich§! and his §OVhy§! would quickly become the dominant force against the §RPrandialist-Marksist§! militias in the last unconquered territory. He spoke of realities that were still mere dreams, and a new kind of war that was just what the Queen needed. This would end up landing them all right by her side, where his eerie ideas could be put to best use.\n\nDespite increasing influence from foreign nations who, by hook or by crook, would see the Changelings laid low, Chrysalis would attempt a massive invasion of §RCanterlot§!, capital of the eternal enemy, §REquestria§!. This conflict in §Y1002§! was doomed to disaster only by unexpected magics, and left the Queen with a humiliating defeat that invited the worst enemy yet – §RThoraxians§!, who would see the entire race bow to the foe.\n\nNow, there is but one solution left: §CExtreme violence on an unimaginable scale§!, as is the traditional way. An attache exists in the §OGriffonian Empire§! to assist with the modernization of the army, and §COlenia§!, currently suffering from internal issues of their own, is a juicy piece of meat to prepare for the coming war. §REquestria§! itself is as stagnant as ever, and its immense power is held by cowards and fools.\n\nWhen the dead number in the millions, remember that the other nations hate you. If you do not gain hegemony by bullet and blade, then they will have your state dismantled permanently – §Rby any means necessary§!."
