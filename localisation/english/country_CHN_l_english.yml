CHN_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Karabiner 98k"
CHN_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Early Changeling designs for bolt-action rifles were often confused and unreliable. The Karabiner 98, along with the rest of the project to create an infantry loadout to Dieter's design, wound up being the first to work well when properly mass-produced. The rifle would be the mainstay of the Heer until the end of the war."
CHN_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Gewehr mod. 1007"
CHN_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Gewehr 7"
CHN_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "Dieter's plans proved to be a good blueprint, but they weren't designed with any normal race in mind. Modifications to the infantryman's kit to take advantage of new discoveries quickly found themelves in order, and the Changeling military obsession with grenades began to appear."
CHN_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Machinenpistole 1010"
CHN_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "MP 90"
CHN_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The MP-80 project, unexpectedly, was one of the first new-generation Changeling firearms completed, being that Dieter already had a working model to pattern off of. Finding their place in the doctrine, however, took much longer, as Changeling officers didn't trust the diminutive cartridge at first, but it would eventually become the most iconic Changeling weapon of the war."
CHN_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Stormrifle 1013"
CHN_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "SR 13"
CHN_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The StormRifle marked a turning point in weapons developement. It was the first time the desire came before the design, although there was still much inspiration. Sadly, the forward-thinking design came with too many mechanical quirks to be a standard weapon."
CHN_infantry_equipment_x:0 "Stormrifle 1019"
CHN_infantry_equipment_x_short:0 "SR 19"
CHN_infantry_equipment_x_desc:0 "The most mature Changeling infantry loadout came in 1019, during the Second Hearthswarming Crisis, where, at the height of their power, the Second Wehrmacht gave this rifle to certain high-value units. Underbarrel attachments were very common in this pattern, which made it expensive."
CHN_infantry_equipment_x_2:0 "Project-Ultra Rifle 25"
CHN_infantry_equipment_x_2_short:0 "PUR"
CHN_infantry_equipment_x_2_desc:0 "Although it never had widespread adoption, this rifle was well-known for its place in the kill-teams fielded by MONOCOL during the later Succession Years. The other implements of destruction were similarly-regarded, especially because so much power was given to tunnel-clearers"

CHN_gw_tank_equipment:0 "Power Cracker X"
CHN_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Although conventional history says that tanks were first fielded during the Stalliongradian revolt, many creatures (nearly all of them Changelings) would argue that the true first usage was a kind of mobile cannon favored during the later Unification Wars. The Power Cracker was an evolution on that design, most notable for having an engine instead of holes in the floor. It never saw use before the Panzers became dominant."

CHN_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2:0 "Sturmtiger"
CHN_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_short:0 "Sturmtiger"
CHN_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Sturmtiger was a siege mortar built into a Tiger hull. Despite this being an offensive weapon made during a defensive war, it made a name for itself in the Major Offensive. By day, the armor protected them from counterbatteries, and by night, the job was done by the ghostly wails coming from the barrel when the breach was left open and the crew inside snored, which caused attacking ponies to retreat out of fear."
CHN_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3:0 "Geschützwagen Tiger"
CHN_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "Based on the hull of a King Tiger, it was to be able to mount a 170mm K 72 L/50 gun. However, the sole prototype built was destroyed when it was used as cover when the factory designing it fell under attack."

CHN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1:0 "Linebreaker T2 Canoe"
CHN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Linebreaker T6 Canoe was an early version of the Linebreaker that held a heavy artillery piece in the bed. Although it was intended to be the main gun, it could still be pitched up, and this was its most useful configuration. The nickname came from the open top of the long, now-flat design."

CHN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_2:0 "Panzerjäger Tiger (CM)"
CHN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Elefant (Elephant) was a heavy tank destroyer based on the chassis of the cancelled Carapace Motors Tiger Project and fitted with an 88 mm Panzerabwehrkanone 43/2 gun."

CHN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3:0 "Panzerjäger Tiger Ausf. B"
CHN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Jagdtiger was the heaviest armoured fighting vehicle operationally used by Changeling Heer. The vehicle carried a 128 mm PaK 44 L/55 main gun, and carried heavy frontal armour."
CHN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_short:0 "Jagdtiger"
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "Linebreaker"
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Linebreaker program was a series of prototypes designed to combine Dieter's high-mobility armored assault strategy with a more old-styled focus on special high-energy designs. However, magic and industry function on different rules, and the resulting designs were scrapped for being unable to do anything extremely well and being horribly expensive."
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Linebreaker"
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger"
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Tiger I was a Changeling heavy tank developed in 1012 as an answer to the unexpectedly impressive Stalliongradian armour encountered in the initial months of the Changeling invasion of the Equestria, particularly the T-34 and the KV-1. To this end, it did its job masterfully whenever it wasn't suffering some sort of technical issue, which it usually was."
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Tiger"
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_3:0 "Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausf. B Tiger II"
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Known under the informal name 'Trnir-Tiger' but, often semi-literally translated as the Bigger Tiger by Equestrian soldiers, the Tiger II combined the thick armour of the Tiger I with the sloped armour used on the Panther medium tank. The tank weighed almost seventy metric tons, and was the first to use Thaumatic Sabot rounds, making it able of penetrating nearly anything."

CHN_light_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "Towed guns which were assigned to the infantry gun companies of motorised infantry regiments had difficulties keeping up with tanks during combat. The easiest solution was to modify a spare tank chassis to carry it into battle. In the case of the Bison, it uses the chassis of the Panzer I."

CHN_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_short:0 "JagdLeopard"
CHN_light_tank_equipment_1:0 "Panzerkampfwagen I"
CHN_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Panzer I was a light tank produced in Changeling Lands in the 1000's, and the first of many tanks to have Dieter's influence. Design of the Panzer I began in 1005 and some production began in 1006. Intended only as a training tank to introduce the concept of armoured warfare to the Changeling Heer, the PzKpfw I found use anyways as a stopgap until more advanced tanks could be produced."
CHN_light_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Panzer I"
CHN_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen II"
CHN_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Panzer II was originally designed as a second stopgap, but was found to be capable enough to function as a frontline tank, and thus entered mass production regardless. A number of issues caused by immature doctrine were pre-empted and solved, and then a whole host of new ones were added because the nation had started mass-producing cars within the last decade and this was much more complicated."
CHN_light_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Panzer II"
CHN_light_tank_equipment_3:0 "VK 1602 Leopard"
CHN_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The VK1602 Leopard was a planned Changeling reconnaissance vehicle designed in 1012. However, what was turned in was an armored car with a rocket launcher taped to the top as a protest against severe budget cuts. This proved to be more economical, so the design was accepted, causing the director to go mad and light the blueprints on fire. This is not that design."

CHN_medium_tank_aa_equipment_1:0 "Flakpanzer III Möbelwagen"
CHN_medium_tank_aa_equipment_1_desc:0 "Nicknamed Möbelwagen because of its boxy turret when closed, it was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun built from the chassis of the Panzer III tank and armed with a 20mm quad-gun."

CHN_medium_tank_aa_equipment_2:0 "Flakpanzer IV Ostwind"
CHN_medium_tank_aa_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Flakpanzer IV 'Ostwind' was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun based on the Panzer IV tank. It was developed in 1012 as a successor to the earlier Flakpanzer IV. The Panzer IV's turret was removed and replaced with an open-top, hexagonal turret which housed a 3.7 cm FlaK 43. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but this was not possible due to the heavy smoke generated by the gun."
CHN_medium_tank_aa_equipment_2_short:0 "Ostwind"
CHN_medium_tank_aa_equipment_3:0 "Flakpanzer Coelian"
CHN_medium_tank_aa_equipment_3_desc:0 "Flakpanzer Coelian was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun design by KLA Arsenal in 1014 for the Changeling armed forces. It was intended to be armed with two 3.7 cm FlaK 43 gun in a fully enclosed, rotating turret on the hull of a Panther medium tank."

CHN_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_1:0 "Grille"
CHN_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Sd.Kfz. 138/1 Grille was a Self-Propelled Artillery Piece that was used by Changelings during Invasion of Equestria. They were popular in Panzer divisions fighting in rough terrain. The name comes from the fact that the radiator was replaced with a smaller, cheaper version, not realizing the weight wasn't much different from the normal chassis. The engine block could be used to cook meat."

CHN_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_1:0 "Sturmgeschütz III"
CHN_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Sturmgeschütz III assault gun was the Changeling's most produced armoured fighting vehicle during invasion of Equestria. It was built on the chassis of the proven Panzer III tank. Initially intended as a mobile, armoured light gun for infantry support, the StuG was continually modified and was widely employed as a tank destroyer."

CHN_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2:0 "Jagdpanzer IV"
CHN_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Jagdpanzer IV served in the anti-tank sections of Panzer divisions. They were very successful tank destroyers but performed badly when used out of role as substitutes for tanks or assault guns."

CHN_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3:0 "Jagdpanther"
CHN_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Jagdpanther was a tank destroyer built on the chassis of the Panther tank. It entered service late in 1014. The Jagdpanther combined the very powerful 8.8 cm PaK 43 cannon of the Tiger II and the characteristically excellent armour and suspension of the Panther chassis."
CHN_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_short:0 "Jagdpanther"
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "Panzerkampfwagen III"
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "From the start, the plan was for the martial industry to teethe on Panzer I and II's before transferring to the real threats:\nThe Panzer III and IV were to be similar designs, with the III specialized for fighting infantry with a stubby HE-thrower and the IV for fighting armor with a long cannon, with both able to play the role of the other in a pinch. Which they did, especially in the later war."
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Panzer III"
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen IV"
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed with a long 75mm "Kwaker" anti-tank gun as its primary armament, the Panzer IV was the main battle tank of the Heer for much of the war, and never truly left service.\nIt is now remembered for two unique abilities: being up-armored once a year until the engine and transmission were no longer reliable, and being misidentified as a Tiger regularly."
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Panzer IV"
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "Panzerkampfwagen V Panther"
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Panther is the common name of a medium tank deployed by Changelings from mid-1014. It was intended as a counter to the Stalliongradian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside the heavier Tiger tank. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks ever created."

CHN_modern_tank_equipment_x_desc:0 "The Standardpanzer series was an attempt by Changelings to produce a standardised, modern, and domestic series of tank designs that has started in 1016. There were to be standard designs in three different weight classes. The Standardpanzer-50 was intended as a standard medium tank, replacing the Panther and Tiger tank series and the conversions based on those tanks."

Due to their use of electricity, previous iterations could be nullfiied by Fair Day meshes, which were so easy to work with that they could even be used as personal armor. This model had a magical sorting mechanism to allow it to only aim at 'animated' things, meaning living beings, but also vehicles."

nuke_first.1.d_changeling_fascism:0 "Queen Chrysalis sat in the bunker, staring eagerly across the open field. In the far distance, a speck, a tower carrying a steel oval, sat. Between the two, miles of land and an inch of protective glass.\nNearly a dozen scientists and engineers were watching, but they didn't get to push the custom-made giant red button with a skull painted on it. The head theoretician hung up his phone just as a buzzer went off, and said, "We are go for operations. Start when ready." Before he could finish saying the last sentence, the Queen slammed down on the button with all her might, causing a brilliant teal flash from the tower.\nThe theoretician was torn between concern at the spectacular size of the weapon's effect, and the fact that the Queen was staring at it, jaw hanging open limply in adoration. Such a massive explosion, such a noise - and it left behind a poison that her own changelings were nearly immune to. It was perfect."

Only under the leadership of Queen Chrysalis can our race know unity and prosperity."
CHN_support_workers:0 "Aid For Worker Families"
CHN_support_workers_desc:0 "Millions of changelings are working hard to ensure the future of the nation. They are the ones responsible for supplying the military with everything it needs, and they are the foundation of our upcoming victory. The government will provide additional care for the common changeling. Let this prove to all that Chrysalis is only ruthless to her enemies and genuinely cares for her loyal subjects!"
CHN_state_propaganda:0 "Final Propaganda Wave"
CHN_state_propaganda_desc:0 "The propaganda machine has been in motion since before Chrysalis was born, but it is needed especially now. The Ministry of Information will begin a new propaganda campaign. Everybody who lives in the country will come to the conclusion that changeling hegemony should be the ultimate goal of every citizen and that under the leadership of Queen Chrysalis, this goal will be reached."

unite_the_people_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis has gained overwhelming support once again. She and her government commission will be organizing several long trips across the hives of the nation.

We will only prevail by working together."
hive_funding:0 "Broad Support of Smaller Hives"
hive_funding_desc:0 "While the great and teeming hives of Vesalipolis, Vraks, Ditrysium, Soryth and Lyctida are mighty centers of industry, countless minor hives are scattered across our territory. We must ensure that they are not neglected and that their changelings are grateful to their Queen, for together they are as vital as any major hive. In return, we expect them to make their contribution for the nation."
Expansion_of_newhives:0 "Continue Hive Modernisation"
Expansion_of_newhives_desc:0 "Due to our isolation, many hives have fallen behind in economic and societal development. This will not do in the age of the war of tanks and machine guns. The more advanced hives must aid the lesser ones, to make our entire nation strong and modern. Public projects and savvy investments will turn dilapidated and backwards caverns into shining, efficient and modern hives."
steel_industry:0 "Vraksian Steelworks"
steel_industry_desc:0 "Northern mountains are rich in iron ore. However, to use it efficiently, means of transport across the country and processing plants will have to be built. The military hive of Vraks is the ideal location for the latter, as the Vraksians will be able to quickly refine the steel into weapons of war. Commoragh will be overseeing the project and guarantees the Queen that it will be finished on schedule."

research_air:0 "Modern Military Aircraft"
research_air_desc:0 "Victory will be achieved by annihilating the enemy's ground forces. We must focus on supporting our own armies with sufficient air superiority. While changelings have always been able to fly and wage aerial warfare, aircraft have completelty changed its nature. We must adapt and continuously improve our designs and pilot training programs."
improve_economy:0 "Subsidise Entrepreneurs"
improve_economy_desc:0 "The new industrial economy is, more than any before it, hungry for specialists and leadership. By giving explicit government support to the technocrats, the managers, and the driven, we can make the finer details of our economy sort itself out without anything leaving the sight of our Queen. Then we shall have the wealth to fight our wars."
CHN_soryth:0 "Soryth"
CHN_soryth_desc:0 "Soryth, the hive-city which lies on the hilly shores of the Key Lake, is a solemn northern hive with the best magical university in the country, among other things.

send_spies_to_EQS:0 "Infiltrate Equestria"
send_spies_to_EQS_desc:0 "The lessons learned from our previous invasion of Canterlot have been very insightful. During this war, proper reconnaissance of our enemies' industrial and military capacities will not only be beneficial, but vital. Our agents can also wreak havoc among their ranks, as so far nocreature is capable of countering our shapeshifting abilities."
steal_tech:0 "Spies in High Places"
steal_tech_desc:0 "Beyond causing trouble behind enemy lines, well-placed spies can steal valuable intelligence from our enemies.

This way we can maintain our technological supremacy and prevent ourselves from falling behind our enemies."
CHN_develop_vesalipolis:0 "Vesalipolis"
CHN_develop_vesalipolis_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis has decided to develop the capital hive of Vesalipolis. We shall introduce a subway system, construct an underground factory as well as an oil refinery, and finance new construction projects in the hive-city. The largest urban area on Equus will become even greater, the envy of the entire world, a testament to the prosperity of the changeling nation."
CHN_develop_ditrysium:0 "Ditrysium"
CHN_develop_ditrysium_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis now decrees that the northern naval port-city, Ditrysium, must be developed. She has ordered the construction of two naval dockyards and financing of the production of naval supplies. New railroads will be built as well, along with expanded fisheries. Queen Helvia should be grateful for this, even if the project will be done without her approval."
CHN_develop_vraks:0 "Vraks"
CHN_develop_vraks_desc:0 "Furthermore, Queen Chrysalis demands we develop the southern military center, Vraks. Two new military manufactories will be opened, and she will decide whether further construction projects will be initiated, or if the efficiency of pre-existing factories will be improved. Chrysalis demands we complete the project without issues, so Queen Argynnis doesn't get satisfaction from our failure."
air_research:0 "Equestrian Aircraft"
air_research_desc:0 "Our infiltrators in the Equestrians' R&D departments have managed to steal various aircraft schematics that can be used to enhance our own designs. Their pegasi are competent designers, it must be admitted. But they are poor with security."

technology_centre_desc:0 "Modernisation of the capital and the central regions of the country are underway. More changelings, more opportunities. A grand research complex in northern area of the Vesalipolis hive has been under construction for several years now. In next couple of months the facilities and equipment will be moved in. Glory to changeling science!"

industrial_research_desc:0 "The core of our country requires quick modernisation in terms of transport. The hives grow evermore, as do their interstate and intrastate transport needs. Railroads will be constructed both above and under the ground, providing quick, affordable and reliable transport for all. Especially the soldiers."
arctic_shelf_mining:0 "Deal with Dennites"
arctic_shelf_mining_desc:0 "In the far north, life on the wrong side of Key Lake has caused a number of our brethren to become degenerated into sentient wildlife. They are undisciplined, rowdy, senselessly violent, and living on oil-filled land. If we want their oil, we cannot easily exterminate them for the mountains they live in, but they can be bribed to not attack."
pressure_olenia:0 "Pressure Olenia"
pressure_olenia_desc:0 "With Olenia still in its decrepit state under [OLE.GetLeader] and our military might increasing rapidly, it is time to revise the borders between our nations and show the world that we are taking our rightful place as the master of Equus. By asserting our dominance over them, we will set the stage to encompass them completely."
offer_puppet:0 "Peaceful Integration of Olenia"
offer_puppet_desc:0 "While we could easily crush Olenia, it might be more worthwhile to propose [OLE.GetLeader] a peaceful alternative to war. By offering our 'protection' and allowing Olenians limited autonomy, we can focus our forces elsewhere. This way changeling lives will be spared and Olenia secured without a single drop of blood. Should they refuse our generous offer however, we can still have our war."
conquest:0 "Conquest of Olenia"
conquest_desc:0 "Olenia has never had any like of us. There is no doubt that they will turn against the Changeling Lands once they are finished their internal struggles. Equestrian and Stalliongradian influence in Olenia grows each day, threatening our shiny new sphere of influence. There is only one thing that can secure our interests:\nWar."
national_resources:0 "Olenian Steel"
national_resources_desc:0 "With the former Olenia territories of Feer Daler and Solgud Bergskedja under our control, we have access to great deposits of iron ore. However, the deer did not utilize this resource to its full potential. We will send battalions of prisoners to work the rocky wastes, allowing them to earn redemption through back-breaking labor."

military_minds:0 "Reorganise High Command"
military_minds_desc:0 "The old guard from the Canterlot Invasion has been sitting idle ever since. It is time to get them back into shape and 'retire' those who failed us before. New and fresh blood will be brought in, their young minds full of innovative ideas on how to develop the art of war."
war_academy:0 "Finalize Reorganization"
war_academy_desc:0 "The Canterlot Invasion showed many things, but the lesson it taught about our army was that new tactics with new technology truly is the way forwards. Our storm teams ran roughshod over the guards for hours before the divine intervention! With our path forwards clear, it is time to let the concrete set on our new doctrines."
prepare_for_war:0 "Final War Preparations"
prepare_for_war_desc:0 "The time to take our place at the top of the world is almost upon us. Therefore we need to finish last minute preparations for the second invasion; roads, airbases and fortifications must be constructed quickly. We will also stockpile a tremendous amount of supplies for the coming operation and begin large-scale military exercises on the border."
prepare_for_war2:0 "Roads and Air Bases"
prepare_for_war2_desc:0 "Both roads and airfields are important for any military maneuvers. Building up important infrastructure will ensure our war goes smoothly and that our soldiers remain well supplied with fresh meat without resorting to plunder, while air bases will be needed for our airforce so it can more easily achieve air supremacy over the enemy."
prepare_for_war3:0 "Work for the Front"
prepare_for_war3_desc:0 "Ensuring we have the means to keep our armies supplied is a priority in a time of war. Building up is our only option. Every changeling must temporarily work harder and longer and sacrifice themselves for the glory of the Queen and her nation. Once we have inevitably won, working hours will surely be reduced again."
demand_equestria:0 "Lead the Armies"
demand_equestria_desc:0 "The time has come to seek our redemption from the failure at Canterlot! The time has come to destroy our primary rival and assume our rightful position as the masters of Equus.

continuous_war_plan_CHN:0 "Implement A Continuous War Plan"
continuous_war_plan_CHN_desc:0 "While some within the hives speak out against the current war and the toll it is taking on our populace, they matter little. We must be prepared to wage war indefinitely, until victory is finally achieved. Dissidents will not be tolerated. We must triumph at any cost."
death_or_dishonour:0 "The Writhing Masses"
death_or_dishonour_desc:0 "In the heart of every Changeling is a hunger for victory against the Equestrian titan, no matter the cost to the nation - or the self. No creature understands the necessity of sacrifice as we do, and there shall be no complaints as each is made to kill and die for an end to the hunger. Old, young, rich, poor. All will be used."

chn_navymimic_desc:0 "Changelings fear the ocean. Such a massive body of water evokes images of floods that claim entire neighborhoods overnight.

It has been many years since she was defeated there, when the race she had so laboriously united came close to sundering apart. But those painful memories can now be forgotten.

CHN_olenian_factories_desc:0 "The Olenian coastline houses some of their most advanced factories. Unfortunately for us, utilising said complexes for our own benefit has proven rather difficult with the numerous partisans and ruffians harrasing our supply lines in the country's interior.

CHN_high_command_cabinet_2:0 "Officers and Communications"
CHN_high_command_cabinet_2_desc:0 "To fill in gaps created by the recent reorganization of the ranks, promising officers will be promoted to higher positions.

Dedicated signallers will be added to all units."
CHN_high_command_cabinet_3:0 "Order and Discipline"
CHN_high_command_cabinet_3_desc:0 "Dissent among the ranks will not be tolerated. We must fight as one, and deviancy from rules and commands must be punished severely.

Most importantly, they will be useful for our military operations."
CHN_demand_yak:0 "Invade the Yaks"
CHN_demand_yak_desc:0 "The yaks are a proud warrior race, and they will not be subdued easily.

CHN_diplo_2:0 "New Fighting Styles"
CHN_diplo_2_desc:0 "The nature of the conflict seems to be that we are unable to build new organizational structures for divisions to take advantage of our new technology.

As his strategy tends to focus around living wave attacks, our preparation for this should prepare to counter it by building huge stores of ammo for cannons and machine guns, the way we know to put a stop to those."
CHN_sombra_war_2:0 "The Inevitable Outcome"
CHN_sombra_war_2_desc:0 "The time has come to dispose of one more threat to our future. His soldiers will feel lucky that they know no pain when their perverse leader is sent away for good and the survivors see how we have cleaved through their comrades-in-arms. Then our nation can truly be sole hegemon of the continent."
CHN_nmm_war:0 "The Next Conflict"
CHN_nmm_war_desc:0 "While they were a wonderful boon to begin with, the Lunar Empire was, is, and always will be a thrall of the godly intentions of their godly leader. As long as they exist on the continent, they remain a threat to our race, who their deity considers misbegotten and abhorrent as all do. We should prepare to secure our continued existence by the sword once more."
CHN_nmm_war_2:0 "Shatter the Sky"
CHN_nmm_war_2_desc:0 "With Celestia gone, there is little preventing us from disposing of her twisted sister and making the continent a place we can live in. The gods shall tyrannize us no more: we will seize the night as we have seized the day, and none will be able to stand against us."
CHN_demand_nml:0 "Venture Militarism"
CHN_demand_nml_desc:0 "The last holdouts of Equestrian thought can be found in New Mareland, especially in the city of Sunset. If it has been deemed our path that we should scourge the Equestrian nation from world influence, then tracking down their more cowardly leaders and dragging them back to our side of the ocean is a good final step to ensure they should never think about rising again."

CHN_Heer:0 "The Heer"
CHN_Heer_desc:0 "The Heer is the standing army of the Changeling Lands. Its roots are in the old armies of the hives, yet the injections of new blood and ideas have not left it unscathed, and now it is a fortress of war pragmatism. By going with them, we will get great results without risk of political ideology overriding military theory."
CHN_Infantry_2:0 "New Tools of Death"
CHN_Infantry_2_desc:0 "A well trained army is nothing without the firearms to back it up. We have all manner of theoretical designs which can surpass modernity in how the common soldiers fight, if applied. Our weapon designers will be put to work coming up with improved and more effective designs for the equipment of the army."
CHN_Infantry_1:0 "Continued Weapon Development"
CHN_Infantry_1_desc:0 "This is not enough! With the future of war before us as an open book, there is no excuse to settle. Attempts at improving our designs must never end, and we will stop at nothing short of perfection. There is always room for improvement."
CHN_Chemical_Weapons:0 "Establish RCAMICD"
CHN_Chemical_Weapons_desc:0 "The Royal Changeling Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defence will ensure that our artillery can flush out any potential hostiles by denying them access to key areas without specialised forces equipped to deal with chemical warfare."
CHN_Jager_1:0 "Improved Jaeger Tactics"
CHN_Jager_1_desc:0 "The modern 'Yegir' is an odd evolutionary mix of the pre-Heavenly-War Grisnak 'battlefield infiltrator' with the new terrain specialist infantry concept. As a kind of soldier, their tactics are still largely untested and undeveloped, and their potential is unrealized. Yet, especially in the cities, there may soon be no more terrifying foe."
CHN_Motorized_1:0 "Motorised Equipment"
CHN_Motorized_1_desc:0 "More modern and reliable trucks and other vehicles are a necessity for any army that relies on fast movement of its forces. While we do not necessarily have the industrial capacity to motorize our entire army, we can still equip numerous battalions with them, so they can support our armoured spearhead in its assault."
CHN_Blitzkrieg_1:0 "Marathon Panzers"
CHN_Blitzkrieg_1_desc:0 "The future of warfare lies with tanks and the effective use of their capabilities. With their firepower and armour, they can breach through defensive lines, and with their speed, they can quickly envelop enemy forces, forming large cauldrons that can then be destroyed by infantry. These machines of war, perfected versions of our own ideal forms, will be the key to our victory."
CHN_Blitzkrieg_2:0 "Panzer Panzers"
CHN_Blitzkrieg_2_desc:0 "Continued modernisation of our armored forces will guarantee that they will remain effectively impervious to all future threats. As our enemies develop anti-tank weaponry, we need to improve our armor, and as they develop their doctrines, we need to evolve ours. With the trajectory of their weapons already known, there is no excuse for falling behind."
CHN_Magical_Infantry:0 "Magical Infantry"
CHN_Magical_Infantry_desc:0 "Use of magical crystals in weapons has long been studied by our scientists, and now designs are becoming effective enough to see widespread use. Giving our infiltrator units this specialised, yet harder to produce equipment will ensure that not only can they more easily take out important targets, but if they get detected can stay alive too."
CHN_MP_bonus:0 "Martial Law"
CHN_MP_bonus_desc:0 "Our imperial ambitions will necessitate a substantial amount of development of our military police infrastructure and forces. However, the recent decades of civil unrest mean that we have plenty of experts and experience to draw upon."

CHN_Doctrines_2:0 "Foreign Ideas"
CHN_Doctrines_2_desc:0 "There is no reason we may only learn from our own mistakes. All around the world, nations fall into internal and external conflicts, and in each case there are new lessons to be learned about the weapons and technologies of today."
CHN_Infiltrators_desc:0 "Stealth and deception have always been integral to changeling warfare. Even though they failed before the gods as usual in 1002, these tactics will still be useful to us if we learn to apply them to the modern era. The training of our infiltrators must be adapted to take the nature of the new war into account."
CHN_Support_Companies_1:0 "Support Equipment"
CHN_Support_Companies_1_desc:0 "Investing in better support equipment is just as important as investing into weapons. Support companies with specialized roles such as reconnaissance, engineering and healthcare will greatly improve the performance of our soldiers. These companies in turn need equipment tailored to their needs."
CHN_Motorized_2:0 "Panzermotorized"
CHN_Motorized_2_desc:0 "Infantry in "Panzercars" with half-tracks and mounted machine guns perform far better than normal motorized units. It is the final form of the original conception of the tank as a mobile machine gun nest. Placing them besides our normal Panzer tanks to help nullify threats to both would make each far more effective, and the soldiers within far more likely to survive."
CHN_Dedicated_Panzer_Production:0 "Dedicated Panzer Production"
CHN_Dedicated_Panzer_Production_desc:0 "Having entire factories produce nothing but panzers for our army will invariably speed up the process, and keep any materials from going to waste on failed tanks. This is necessary as we not only need to form new armored battalions, but replenish any lost tanks and produce spare parts for the ones currently in service."
CHN_Dedicated_Motorized_Production:0 "Dedicated Motorised Production"
CHN_Dedicated_Motorized_Production_desc:0 "Dedicating some of our industry to producing cars and trucks for our motorised forces will speed up our army overall. Mobility is the key to modern warfare, and the mobility of our hooves and wings is simply not enough. Eventually, it is to be hoped, we can motorize all infantry battalions, but this grand project will take many years."
CHN_Infantry_Academy:0 "Royal Infantry Academy"
CHN_Infantry_Academy_desc:0 "It has always been the thought that the best place to send elite units is to work as buraeucrats in the enemy's government while the army is made of masses of levies. With the different mode and sheer scale of the coming war, however, a special facility in Vraks that exclusively trains elite warriors is now justifiable."
CHN_Vhy:0 "The Vhy"
CHN_Vhy_desc:0 "The Vhy is led by a vaguely charismatic and extremely deadly changeling named Dieter Heinrich, who appeared in the hinterlands of Lyctida only a few decades ago. He came from a far away land where the struggles of today have already played out, and thus he knows the advantages and disadvanates of a number of radical changes. His ideas will lead us down a road that no other has travelled."
CHN_mwdoctrine_1:0 "New Maneuver War"
CHN_mwdoctrine_1_desc:0 "The essence of changeling war has always been about speeding down a prepared land to plunder at will. In the modern era, plunder is not enough to sustain an army, yet speed is enough to bring it victory at all levels. Our forces must be flexible, but fully-forwards."
CHN_mwdoctrine_2:0 "Tank Supremacy"
CHN_mwdoctrine_2_desc:0 "Out of all the war machines we now have, none are as important as the infantryman - yet none are as dangerous to the infantryman than the tank. These metal creatures can send body parts flying from hundreds of meters away, or trample the foe directly. Their value cannot be understated or underutilized."
CHN_mwdoctrine_3:0 "Unsere Kampfgruppe"
CHN_mwdoctrine_3_desc:0 "Flexibility, flexibility, flexibility. War is chaos, and chaos is unsurvivable for any who are rigidly stuck to long-term plans. High levels of command autonomy in the lower echelons mixed with tactical maleability leaves us far more able to weather the incoherentness."
CHN_mwdoctrine_4:0 "Spiritual Mobilisation"
CHN_mwdoctrine_4_desc:0 "To win, not only must we defeat the enemy, we must defeat our own doubts and concerns. No more shall our hunger for soldiers go unrequited due to lack of bodies. We are fighting for our species, and there is only victory or death for us all."
CHN_panzerkrieg_1:0 "Brand New Special Unique"
CHN_panzerkrieg_1_desc:0 "In the arms race of tank technology, the next step can only be the 'medium tank', a device heavier and more expensive than a light tank but well-armed enough to dispatch nearly any other armored or hardened target. Soon, the light tank will be worthless before these. Of course, as technology marches on, even these will be outdated..."
CHN_panzerkrieg_2:0 "Bring New Replace Antique"
CHN_panzerkrieg_2_desc:0 "The arms race continues, and the step coming ahead is revealed to be the 'heavy tank', a yet more fearsome and short-run monstrosity. They are a sight to behold and their noises soothe the soul, and we will ride them into the future, knowing that there may be a day when even they are also not dangerous enough for our foes."
CHN_infequip_1:0 "Reichswehr"
CHN_infequip_1_desc:0 "In the long run, such things as planes and enemy tanks will be on the battlefield, and it cnanot be assumed that we will be able to counter them with our own that just happened to be nearby. Smaller, cheaper countermeasures placed alongside normal superior technology for the front-line soldier will ensure our infantry has no weakness."
CHN_supportequip_1:0 "Deep Assault"
CHN_supportequip_1_desc:0 "Experience has shown that conflicts into underdeveloped hellholes filled with undercreatures such as Equestria demand ways to salvage, maintain, and replace equipment in the field in order to maintain material readiness. To this end, magical weapons and their finnicky and unreliable actions are wholly unnecessary."
CHN_infequip_2:0 "Future Weapons"
CHN_infequip_2_desc:0 "The rocket is the most potent tool of attack in the modern age. On a strategic level, it can bomb enemy territory without placing a single life at risk, but more importantly is the tactical level, in which a single soldier with a small rocket can defeat tanks easily. The new generation of anti-tank weapons to protect our modern soldiers must come soon."
CHN_vampire:0 "Vampyr"
CHN_vampire_desc:0 "Normally the night is closed off to us by a curse from the deity of the darkness herself, but magical spotlights can turn night into day easily. Their non-trivial power consumption demands we sacrifice in some places for batteries to power them, but the cost is worth it, even if just a few select units are left with the ability to see in night as day."
CHN_ndlogistics:0 "Non-Discriminatory Logistics"
CHN_ndlogistics_desc:0 "Our need for more soldiers on the field has been fought against by simple lack of weaponry to give them. Yet our glorious soil provides the answer yet again. We shall dig up every weapons cache, buy-back every take-home, and truly make it so that every changeling can be given enough weapons to make do if they must."
CHN_fashwave:0 "Terror Aesthetics"
CHN_fashwave_desc:0 "Recent political events have resulted in a severe lack of faith in our glorious racially-pure government. By making it the fashion of our army to dress aggressively and ostentatiously, we can sow terror amongst our own ne'er-do-wells so that none dare speak out against us for fear of incurring their wrath."
CHNeinvolkeinreich:0 "Ein Volk Ein Reich"
CHNeinvolkeinreich_desc:0 "There is but one changeling volk, and but one changeling state to contain it. It is unacceptable that any should shirk their duty to keep it protected into the future, for they are selling away not just their own posterity, but our entire species' existence."
CHNkaltestahlhertz:0 "Kaltes Stahlhertz"
CHNkaltestahlhertz_desc:0 "The roaring of gas-fired pistons, the shriek of a flying terror, the thunder that sits in the strike of their main gun. They sanctify their wielders and purify their enemies. The story is clear now. Our state can and must become one of metal giants who stand ready to defend soldier and civilian alike from the foreign hordes."
CHNtotalenkrieg:0 "Totalen Krieg"
CHNtotalenkrieg_desc:0 "War is won on the battlefield, but the battlefield is won at home. Every gun, every coat, every bullet must be made in the great factories. The perpetuation of our way is to be found in turning them into the northern star of our society which stands still as all the rest rotates around it."

CHN_weareboned:0 "Existential Threat"
CHN_weareboned_desc:0 "An entity has appeared on the world stage which threatens to destroy not only us as a nation, but as a species. Our worst fears and most dire propaganda has been made true: we will be rendered extinct if our enemies win. Victory is meaningless in the face of total destruction, and it is justified to authorize any heinous act to allow us to live another day."
CHN_weareboned2:0 "Desperate times"
CHN_weareboned2_desc:0 "In the olden days, hives could mobilize over half of their population to war in order to make use of opportunities created by significant infiltration. While this made sense in the days of three-month campaigns, it is no longer efficient or sensible. However, we may have no choice if our soldier situation becomes so dire. Anything is better than extinction."
CHN_trials:0 "The Trials"
CHN_trials_desc:0 "Many of our traditions have been banned or reduced as part of a large-scale rebranding. We are called terrible today, but we were far worse in the days before, when anything was allowed because the goal was to destroy cities wholesale and return home with the spoils in carts and pods. By losing all restraint, we can force the enemy to make choices with no good answer."

CHN_Renewed_Militarization:0 "Renew Militarisation"
CHN_Renewed_Militarization_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis has been defeated, and all thanks to the soldiers that fought for friendship. It's time to focus on bringing the Changeling militias from an emergency force to something professional, that any changelings can be proud to serve in."
CHN_Air_Force:0 "Form the Evevehr"
CHN_Air_Force_desc:0 "The changeling air force is a theory with some of the greatest potential out of all of our branches, yet it does not have its own organizational structure yet. It is high time that our air assaulters be given the titles they deserve."
CHN_Air_Doctrine_1:0 "Bomber Doctrine"
CHN_Air_Doctrine_1_desc:0 "In the event of war, a focus upon crippling the enemy's wartime industry will invariably save more lives."
CHN_Air_Doctrine_2:0 "Fighter Doctrine"
CHN_Air_Doctrine_2_desc:0 "In the event of war, ensuring our fighters are as best as they can be will save the lives of those on the ground."
CHN_Bomber_1:0 "Tactical Bombers"
CHN_Bomber_1_desc:0 "Tactical bombers, while not as specialised as ground attack planes, nor strategic bombers, fulfil an important middle ground. Being able to not only strike ground targets, but also performing long range bombing runs."
CHN_Bomber_2:0 "Close Air Support"
CHN_Bomber_2_desc:0 "Dive bombers and other ground attack planes will bring an important advantage to the forces on the ground, keeping the enemy suppressed at longer ranges than conventional fire, and taking out strategic targets."
CHN_Bomber_3:0 "Strategic Bombers"
CHN_Bomber_3_desc:0 "Long range, high altitude strategic bombers can deliver a crippling strike to the industry of a hypothetical enemy. It may be that one factory that builds that one rifle that wins the war."
CHN_Paratroopers:0 "Paratroopers"
CHN_Paratroopers_desc:0 "Using the wings of changeling soldiers allows us to drop more elite units behind enemy lines and take keypoints to, say, encircle them, or to secure ports for a larger invasion."
CHN_Fighter_1:0 "Fighters"
CHN_Fighter_1_desc:0 "Development of fighter aircraft in general is something that would help not only the air force, but also the civilian recreational sector too."
CHN_Fighter_2:0 "Advanced Fighters"
CHN_Fighter_2_desc:0 "More advanced fighters are the stuff of dreams, but what if we decide to turn them from dreams, to reality?"
CHN_Fighter_3:0 "Long Ranged Fighters"
CHN_Fighter_3_desc:0 "Heavy fighters which escort strategic bombers are not only beneficial for the bombers, but they can also be stationed at airfields further from the front line and still be effective."
CHN_Rocketry:0 "Rocket Tests"
CHN_Rocketry_desc:0 "Our proud history of magical research has come full circle as it now becomes possible to build an engine of such high performance that a certain alchemical compound can be used as fuel. These "rockets" will enable us to attack with impunity without placing a single life on the line."
CHN_Wunderwaffe:0 "Tears of The Sun"
CHN_Wunderwaffe_desc:0 "The nuclear theory, codenamed 'wunderwaffe', is our greatest secret as a changeling nation. To let any other nation know about our experiments into splitting the atom would be to risk war."
CHN_Rocketry_Phase_Two:0 "Continued Rocket Tests"
CHN_Rocketry_Phase_Two_desc:0 "The initial tests of solid fuel rockets and pulse jets were successful, but if we move to liquid fuel, not only do we get a better range out of our rockets, but we can lower the throttle when required."
CHN_Jets:0 "Jet Engines"
CHN_Jets_desc:0 "The jet engine is not only a very complex piece of machine, but it can utterly revolutionise civilian aerospace, and the military air space. Higher speeds, longer ranges. But first, we need an engine."
CHN_Jet_Fighter:0 "Jet Fighters"
CHN_Jet_Fighter_desc:0 "With our engine ready for production, we need to develop a plane purpose built for the purpose of flying at high speeds, while under high thrust numbers."
CHN_Jet_Tactical_Bomber:0 "Jet Tactical Bombers"
CHN_Jet_Tactical_Bomber_desc:0 "A mid range tactical bomber has no need to have defensive armament like its conventionally propelled predecessors, as they can theoretically outrun their enemies. In addition, it might make a good passenger plane."
CHN_Jet_Strategic_Bomber:0 "Jet Strategic Bombers"
CHN_Jet_Strategic_Bomber_desc:0 "Not only could cargo and freight make use of a large aircraft that can carry heavier loads, but the power of the jet engine would allow us to carry heavier bomb loads."
CHN_defend_the_north:0 "Northern Defences"
CHN_defend_the_north_desc:0 "Despite our desires to be peaceful and share friendship, other nations are unpredictable. If the North were to fall, our enemy would not only control our coast, but be one step closer to Vesalipolis."
CHN_central_hives:0 "Central Defences"

CHN_submarine_effort:0 "Submarine Designs"
CHN_submarine_effort_desc:0 "All forms of navy benefit from submarines. Not only can they strike slow, lumbering ships, but they can be used to raid enemy convoys and keep their troops from being supplied."
CHN_Naval_Bomber:0 "Torpedo Bombers"
CHN_Naval_Bomber_desc:0 "Naval Torpedo Bombers, when used properly, have the potential to not only sink a ship, but sink an entire hostile fleet. Ensuring we've got the best naval fighters will give us a great advantage."
CHN_Navy_Doctrine:0 "Doctrinal Effort"
CHN_Navy_Doctrine_desc:0 "Without the proper doctrine to support them, no ship is capable of doing its job correctly. Developing better naval theory is paramount."
CHN_Destroyers:0 "Improved Destroyers"

CHN_Escort_Carriers:0 "Escort Carrier Designs"
CHN_Escort_Carriers_desc:0 "While not as large as fleet carriers, escort carriers are useful for ensuring that our smaller fleets have naval air power to back them up, no matter the situation."
CHN_Carriers:0 "Modern Carrier Designs"
CHN_Carriers_desc:0 "Bigger carriers with more deck space is the omega, the end, of the carrier development. Such a ship would be the epitome of naval warfare."
CHN_Heavy_Cruisers:0 "Heavy Cruiser Designs"
CHN_Heavy_Cruisers_desc:0 "Battleships, while no doubt impressive, still need support from their smaller sisters. Heavy cruisers not only provide anti-air support, but also bring main armament to match the might of the battleship."
CHN_Battlecruisers:0 "Battlecruisers Designs"
CHN_Battlecruisers_desc:0 "Even with the impressive combination of firepower from both heavy cruisers and battleships, there still needs to be something in the middle to fill the place of either of the other two if they are otherwise unavailable. A Battlecruiser."
CHN_Battleships:0 "Battleship Designs"

CHN_submarine_carrier:0 "§YSS§!: Urauser Program"
CHN_submarine_carrier_desc:0 "Aircraft carriers are massive and obvious, yet can attack from far away. Submarines are silent and deadly, yet must be near the enemy to strike reliably. Why is it necessarily true that these two classes of ship must be mutually-exclusive? There are plans, theoretical now, which may let us build submarines which assault their foes with aircraft."
CHN_rausers:0 "Luftrausers"
CHN_rausers_desc:0 "A peculiar discovery has been made as part of our submarine warfare. There is a strange metal found in small pools in the ocean which seems to be alive.

CHN_tamato:0 "§YSS§!: Requisition Program"
CHN_tamato_desc:0 "Our lack of naval firepower has led to some unorthodox methods of finding new ships. The oddest is one which demands we invest in a complex magical detection system which will supposedly allow us to find specific objects from other worlds and then bring them here with the use of thaumatic alloy and a lot of electricity. It sounds insane, but so do many things that work."
CHN_steal_rain:0 "Five-Magic Markdown"
CHN_steal_rain_desc:0 "Our success in bringing though the Tamato has emboldened our scientists, and they now believe they can find more ships from the same navy via their spectromagically-distinctive radars.

CHN_threaten_PLB:0 "Threaten the Bear"
CHN_threaten_PLB_desc:0 "It seems words alone will not get us what we want. We will have to show them that we are serious and fully capable of following up on our threats.

CHN_attack_PLB:0 "Strike the Bear"
CHN_attack_PLB_desc:0 "Even after our threats, the bears continue to defy us. It is time to teach them a lesson! We are changelings and we do not let barbaric races dictate terms to us.

CHN_modern_infrastructure_PLB:0 "Infrastructure Improvements for Bears"
CHN_modern_infrastructure_PLB_desc:0 "The Polar territories are in a pitiful state. There are few roads, and even fewer of those are suitable for our heavy industry and military manuevers.

CHN_rehire_recina_desc:0 "The current state of the Zehr is unsatisfactory. Our Admirality is lacking proper leadership, and its pool of admirals are not nearly as capable as we'd like them to be. Queen Helvia of Ditrysium has raised a possible solution, though it is not one that enthuses Chrysalis. Former Admiral Recina, Helvia's sister, is currently languishing under house arrest, but could perhaps be convinced to return to service as a Minister of the Navy.\n\nRecina's reinstatement would upset the current Admirality (all four of them), and buying Recina's service will likely prove costly. She is still annoyed about the circumstances preceding her arrest, and only the offer of a high position in the Zehr could convince her. The disgraced admiral has proven herself in the past though, and this is perhaps one bullet worth biting if we intend to reinvigorate the Zehr."

#IDEAS
chn_queen_helvia:0 "Queen Helvia"
chn_queen_helvia_desc:0 "The young queen of the thriving port hive of Ditrysium is interested in imperial expansion and increase of naval production. While Ditrysium was the first major hive to ally Vesalipolis, Helvia is not as fond of Chrysalis as her predecessor. The Third Prandialist Great Strike of the 970's was a major sticking point, as Chrysalis moved to quell the unrest without consulting Helvia first. However, she is pragmatic and knows maintaining good relations with Vesalipolis is ultimately a positive thing. Interestingly, her birthday falls on the annual taming of the sea, Ditrysium's biggest religious ceremony."
queen_helvia_admiral_tt:0 "Unlocks a §Ydecision§! to recall a §Gskilled admiral§!."
chn_queen_aurantia:0 "Queen Aurantia"
chn_queen_aurantia_desc:0 "The aging queen of the industrial hive-city of Lyctida is able to provide resources and lumber for our railroads and military equipment. Ever since Chrysalis led her alliance to save Lyctida from the Prandialists and Saturnalians (who would later be called the Vhy), she has been her most loyal supporter. She always strives to earn Chrysalis' favor, but is in turn seen as an unusually pawnish monarch. Still, the turbulence in her life has made her a bit better-rounded than many Queens, and there is something to be said for living to the age of 150 in a position where the last three generations have died young."
chn_queen_argynnis:0 "Queen Argynnis"
chn_argynnis_adv_desc:0 "The martial hive of Vraks has always had a tenuous relationship with Vesalipolis, at best. The two had for centuries engaged in skirmishes and raids before Vraks attacked the other hive with full force but was repelled by Chrysalis and her allies from Ditrysium. In 979 Chrysalis struck back with a new, modern military and crushed Vraks in a series of spectacular victories that laid Vraks low. The Queen of the day committed suicide to spare her family the dishonor of her failure, so her oldest sister, Argynnis, took her place and signed the peace treaty, which left her hive a subject of Vesalipolis.\nShe is not the most uncontrollable, but she is the most directly opposed to Chrysalis. However, the victory was fair, so she remains basically in line."
chn_queen_yaria:0 "Queen Yaria"
chn_queen_yaria_desc:0 "Queen of the largest northern hive of Soryth, which lies on the shore of the Key Lake. The Key Lake is known for its concentration of magical energy. Magic helped changelings of Soryth to survive harsh northern weather for generations. Queen Yaria believes that thorough study of magical abilities of crystals is vital for future success of the changeling nation. She is one of the queens who joined Chrysalis voluntarily and genuinely believes she can lead their race to greatness. In her eyes, changelings have the same potential for magic abilities as unicorns, if they only develop it enough."
chn_spymaster:0 "Vaspier Orn Kladisium"
chn_spymaster_desc:0 "Little is known about Vaspier, and what is known is almost always classified. As far as can be confirmed, he appeared in the 980's and took command of the fledgeling VOPS. In 988, it was discovered that he had done this, as he had supposedly been a messanger for the former bosses, who were all missing, retired, or dead in unrelated circumstances. To this day, very few know that he is the one in charge of the organization, hence the title. It was he that built the Changeling intelligence agency, VOPS, into a force to be reckoned with. It was his hoof that guided the operation of Chrysalis' first attack on Canterlot. That failure damaged his pride, and since then, he has worked even harder to make himself useful to his Queen. And in this, he has succeeded. The VOPS is now the most secretive intelligence agency around."

chn_queen_factrix:0 "Queen Factrix"
chn_queen_factrix:0 "Queen Factrix was born to a royal family which would have its hive wiped out by Prandialists when she was in her 30's. Her family would take shelter under their allies, the family of Vesalipolis. Although they were mostly advisors, Factrix would go on to have a storied career after discovering a love of mechanical engineering. It was her who designed the Factrix Gun, a machine gun made from wood and scrap metal which would have a large effect on the Vraks campaign of the Unification Wars.\n\nShe would end up falling in with the Vhy out of a mixture of political convenience, similar ideas about the future of warfare, and a harbored grudge about Equestria supporting the Prandialists early on, which she witnessed firsthand.\nShe is, however, a Monarch first and foremost, and in that regard has no blemishes on her record besides an unfortunate blood relation."
chn_father_mator:0 "Father Mator"
chn_father_mator_desc:0 "Father Mator was born to a royal family which had recently had its hive wiped out by the Prandialists. He was born weak and, like every changeling not in an immediate line of succession, lived his entire life malnourished. Perhaps this unfortunate upbringing is what drove him to look to the sky for answers.\nNow, he leads a religious movement which has taken the herding class by storm. They worship the sun and moon as givers of life and keepers of order, carry weapons to defend themselves from those who would rightly attack them for being race traitors, and their long-term goal is to leave the country and settle elsewhere. Their willingness to adopt foreign customs, languages, and more does make them excellent anti-partisan soldiers.\nIn exchange for cooperation, he has been promised the vast empty plains of the Crystal Empire, on which his flock can build a life alongside the ponies."
chn_urbiates_adv:0 "Urbiates orn Marks"
chn_urbiates_adv_desc:0 "As the only influential member of the Prandialist-Marksist movements who consistently returns our calls, Urbiates is being used as their de facto leader. In truth, he wields no official power, he is merely a popular speaker and commander.\nAs a Prandialist-Marksist, he believes that monarchy is illegitimate, the monarch caste is in a conspiracy to keep drones oppressed, and that changeling hegemony over the world can be brought about via strictly-followed hive-based direct democracy. By now, this movement is over a century old. If this sounds like it is unrelated to the writings of Marks, that's because it is. The sole connection is a tenuous literary reference based off of half-truths and Equestrian propaganda. In the 90's, infiltrators returning from Stalliongrad brought back literature in the hopes of creating their own revolution, and were killed or chased out to a man by Prandialist-Marksists such as Urbiates for being "reactionaries".\nHe and his cohorts have agreed to cooperate in exchange for free reign over large portions of Stalliongrad after the war."
chn_finicus:0 "Minister Finicus"
chn_finicus_adv_desc:0 "Known as "the bug with no soul", Finicus Vesali is the current Minister of Economics. He has an incredible aptitude for math, both in theoretical designs and in practical applications. Most impressive is his ability to condense living beings into useful equations, which has allowed him to expand on the existing economic plans of the state without expanding the amount of casualties that the industrialization is causing. Unfortunately, the queens would send tens of thousands of changelings to die harvesting ores and building factories, and even they find Finicus's frigid attitude towards other creatures unsettling. Finicus would just say that "Changeling economics isn't a discipline for the faint-hearted" and continue designing an expiriment to determine the price of a life."

changelings.1.t:0 "The Other Olenian Question"
changelings.1.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis looked at the draft of the communique she'd spent the past few hours working on. The letter would be sent to [OLE.GetLeader] regarding a terrible revalation about the establishment of new urban zones within Olenian land after a zoning mistake, and how the new herder-posts could not be moved but needed to be within the nation's borders by annexing the lands involved. it was a staggeringly blatant pretense to expand Changeling influence beyond the Hives' borders.\n\nThe communique was a brilliant thing. It demanded the granting of the two northern changeling states to the Hives in exchange for changeling recognition of [OLE.GetLeader] as the true sovereign of Olenia, but the very terms implicitly made the Changeling Lands out to be a nation-state rather than some kind of diplomatic cancer zone. It was also horribly power-hungry in front of a nation who's last experiences with Changelings were all bloody wars, and many of Chrysalis' advisors doubted the Olenian leader would agree to it, as the last thing [OLE.GetLeader] needed to do in the midst of the Olenian civil unrest would be to sign their territory away to a diplomatic cancer zone. But Chrysalis didn't care what option the Olenian leader would do. Either they would grant the territory, or they would refuse, and that would be enough excuse to wage war. Either option pleased Chrysalis, but after all the reorganization the Royal Changeling Heer had gone through in the past decades, she was eager to see her new military at work. No matter which way she looked at it, this communique was a win-win scenario.\n\nIt was time for the race to be feared once more."
changelings.1.a:0 "Let's see if this prey species can realize when it's being hunted."

changelings.2.t:0 "An Olenian Protectorate?"
changelings.2.d:0 ""The situation in Olenia is favorable," Hivesmarshall Trimmel said, gesturing at a map of the deer nation spread across a table before his queen. "The country is tearing itself apart already. Most think King Johan is illegitimate, and Princess Velvet should be the rightful queen. On top of that, the Equestrians have been pushing their disgusting harmonic ways on the nation, while Stalliongrad thinks that Olenia would be better as a communist puppet in the west to outflank Equestrian advances. All of this together means the deer are at each other's throats, and the true disasters haven't even started. It would just be tragic should a foreign power as strong as the Changeling Hives decided it should swoop in and intervene."\n\n"So what are you suggesting?" Chrysalis asked. "Clearly we cannot afford to let either Equestria or Stalliongrad establish closer ties with the Olenians. They are the first domino that needs to fall to take down Equestria, and it won't do if the domino is twice as heavy."\n\n"It's simple, really," Trimmel said. "Offer the Olenians the once in a lifetime opportunity to bow before you and kiss the dirt beneath your hooves. Say that we in the Changeling Hives are worried about the state of affairs in Olenia, and are merely offering our help. And if they refuse, or rather, when they refuse, we can claim it is in our best interests to see to it that we save the deer from themselves. Either way, Olenia bends to us. It just depends on how stupid they are to tell if we need to send in the tanks or not."\n\nChrysalis thought about it for a moment, then grinned. "I like the way you think, Hivesmarshall," she said."\n\nTrimmel grinned back at her. "I like the way I think too, Your Majesty.""
changelings.2.a:0 "Let's see how the deer react to this one."

changelings.3.t:0 "Conquest" ## Empty Event ##

changelings.4.t:0 "States Ceded"
changelings.4.d:0 ""[OLE.GetLeader] truly is spineless," Chrysalis said, reading the response from Olenia with contempt. "Here I was spoiling for a good fight. And the deer fold like a house of cards. Pathetic!"\n\n"It appears reason won out in the end," Hivesmarshall Trimmel stated, bowing his head as Chrysalis fumed that she wouldn't have her fight anymore. "Still, we can call this a victory. There will be further opportunities to subjugate the deer. I'm sure the right one will surface before long."\n\n"It better," Chrysalis said. "If I settle for only taking two states off of the deer, I'm just a bit player. But if I take all of Olenia..." she rubbed her hooves together and giggled. "The deer may have bought themselves some time, but they will be my first conquest, one way or another. Soon they will submit or they will die, and I don't particularly care which one they choose.""
changelings.4.a:0 "This is good enough for now... but it won't satisfy us forever."

changelings.5.t:0 "[From.GetName] Rejects Our Demands!"
changelings.5.d:0 "Hivesmarshall Trimmel read the response of [OLE.GetLeader] with a pleased smile on his face. "Your demands that we cede Solgud Bergskedja and Feer Dalar are utterly preposterous. These lands were given to the deer by the treaty established by King Aldar II, in case you have forgotten. We will not give them back to you just because you demand them. Olenia does not cower before bullies." Trimmel tossed the response aside and shifted his attention toward Queen Chrysalis. "So, my Queen? What do you think?"\n\n"I think it's the excuse we've wanted," Chrysalis said, rubbing her hooves together. "If the deer think that firm words will be all it takes to save them, they will be disappointed. One way or another, they will fall, and I can't wait to see the look on [OLE.GetLeader]'s face when it all comes crashing down on their pathetic excuse for a nation.""
changelings.5.a:0 "The deer will kneel to us, whether they want to do it covered in their own blood or not."

changelings.6.t:0 "Olenia Yields To Our Might"
changelings.6.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis scoffed as she read the response from [OLE.GetLeader] to her demands that the entire country submit to the might of the Changeling Hives. "It was that easy? Pathetic," she said, rolling her eyes and passing the response back to an aide to file away safely. "I guess the deer really are frightened prey. I suppose it's a good thing for them we'll be set to look out for them... so long as they give us the love we deserve." She giggled to herself and sat upright on her throne. "Well, fortunately for the deer, the Heer won't get to try out our new toys on them. Those, we'll save for Equestria. The Olenians can rest assured that they have the might of our armies to protect them from Equestrian influence. We will truly be the kindest and most benevolent guardians of the deer we could be, because if any of them say otherwise, they won't be around long enough to say much else." She rubbed her hooves together. "The first domino has fallen...""
changelings.6.a:0 "Onwards to Equestria!"

changelings.7.t:0 "Olenia Refuses To Yield"
changelings.7.d:0 ""The deer have rejected our offer to surrender, my Queen," Queen's Guard captain Dieter Heinrich said, tossing the Olenian response on the ground before Queen Chrysalis' throne. "And rather rudely, too. They used language that I never thought a non-soldier could know. But, it is just as you expected. The deer are too proud to bow."\n\n"Good," Chrysalis said. "I've been waiting for the opportunity to try out our reorganized Heer. The deer have given me just the excuse to send in the tanks and make some noise. Mobilize the armies. They'll fall before us in moments, crushed under our superior might, and the Olenians will realize what a mistake it was to stand up to us... not that it will save them from what they deserve in the slightest.""
changelings.7.a:0 "They want to do this the hard way? I want to do it the hard way too!"

changelings.8.t:0 "Olenia Surrenders"
changelings.8.d:0 ""Cowards, the lot of them," Hivesmarshall Trimmel said, shaking his head. "I barely started my vehicles before the Olenians folded. My Panzers still have half-full tanks of gasoline. The Olenians must be issued white flags with their soldiery kits, because I've never seen so many fly so quickly. I almost shot at them out of frustration. Almost."\n\nQueen Chrysalis frowned down at her Hivesmarshall, though her ire was not for him. "Were they trying to call a bluff? Did [OLE.GetLeader] really not think we would dare to invade Olenia if they refused? How laughable." She shook her head and waved her hoof to dismiss Trimmel. "Very well, if they won't put up a fight, then we have nothing to gain by slaughtering them save for another enemy. The equipment and bugpower we saved from the Olenians surrendering would be best used against Equestria. They will be the real tough nut to crack, and so we must throw everything we have against them. That's where the real fight lies.""
changelings.8.a:0 "Olenia... all that chest pounding and for what? Dead deer?"

changelings.10.t:0 "War With [VAN.GetName]."
changelings.10.d:0 "A fractured Equestria is a weak Equestria, that much is certain. The current situation in the aftermath of the War of the Two Sisters is very favorable to us as we seek to end this Equestrian blight once and for all. While Equestria struggles to put back together the pieces from its catastrophic civil war, we will be sure to take advantage of the chaos and confusion. The city of Vanhoover is one of Equestria's most important naval ports, and not only that, a significant population of changelings lives in and around the city. It's time that we welcome our brothers and sisters back into the fold with open forelegs, and while we're at it, seize the all-important Equestria dockyards in Luna Bay. Not only will these dockyards be put to better use producing ships for our navy, but it will widen the border against Equestria, giving us an opportunity to outflank the Equestrian left and crush their army before the war has even truly begun. We will need every advantage fighting the Equestrian beast, and picking off one of its strongest city-states will benefit us greatly."
changelings.10.a:0 "Vanhoover will fall, and that'll really give Equestria something to worry about."

changelings.11.t:0 "War With [SCS.GetName]."
changelings.11.d:0 ""A fractured Equestria is a weak Equestria, that much is certain. The current situation in the aftermath of the War of the Two Sisters is very favorable to us as we seek to end this Equestrian blight once and for all. While Equestria struggles to put back together the pieces from its catastrophic civil war, we will be sure to take advantage of the chaos and confusion. The foolish [SCS.GetName] have split off from Equestria. Their supplies of crude oil have made them powerful in their own right, but only a valuable prize for us. Seizing their oil supplies will allow us to run our Panzers for longer than we otherwise could have.  We must take control of this oil and grant our army the freedom to drive as far as it can. Yet another piece of Equestria is ready to fall into our hooves!"
changelings.11.a:0 "Their oil shall be ours!"

changelings.12.t:0 "War With [From.GetName]."
changelings.12.d:0 ""A fractured Equestria is a weak Equestria, that much is certain. The current situation in the aftermath of the War of the Two Sisters is very favorable to us as we seek to end this Equestrian blight once and for all. While Equestria struggles to put back together the pieces from its catastrophic civil war, we will be sure to take advantage of the chaos and confusion. The foolish [From.GetName] have split off from Equestria. The fractured state of our greatest enemy shall make them all the easier to conquer. Piece by piece we shall devour Equestria until there is nothing left to conquer. Divided they shall fall to our might!"
changelings.12.a:0 "To war!"

changelings.14.t:0 "War With [STG.GetName]."
changelings.14.d:0 "[STG.GetName] stands in the way of the ambitions of our Glorious Queen. Not only are they ponies that we must conquer, but they are the home of that disgusting ideology called Communism, which stands in direct opposition to the natural hierarchy of the hives and the changeling species. Letting this state fester in continued existence could only be a disaster. They must be crushed immediately, and we shall make them submit by any means necessary!"
changelings.14.a:0 "To war!"

changelings.16.t:0 "Espionage in Equestria"
changelings.16.d:0 "Vaspier Orn Kladisium paced around his desk, a lit cigarette hanging from his lips. Held in his magic before him were several plain folders, which he opened and looked through one after the other. Early feelers from the first wave of infiltrators sent into the country had identified several weaknesses within the Equestrian state, ranging from things as simple as factory overseers to levels all the way up to the highest order of government. Though the Equestrians were wary of changeling infiltration owing to the world situation and the failed invasion of Canterlot in 1002, they had yet to close off any ways for VOPS to get a hoof inside of the nation. That would be their undoing.\n\nVaspier set the folders aside and pulled up his roster of agents on standby. The greatest strength of the changeling race was their ability to shapeshift into almost any form, but the average changeling had limits to that ability. Without training, a form could only be assumed for so long, and the impersonation could be imperfect. Those familiar with the individual being impersonated would soon sniff out the falsehood standing before them. But the infiltrators of the VOPS were the best of the best, each extensively trained to perfectly impersonate a target, relentlessly drilled for weeks on every detail and habit of their assumed likeness. These infiltrators, Vaspier would release en masse into Equestria. With perfectly placed spies throughout the Equestrian Army, the resulting chaos and confusion would soon make it impossible for them to resist the swarm.\n\nVaspier let his cigarette burn out, then squashed it in an ashtray. Soon, Equestria, just like that cigarette, would be snuffed out."
changelings.16.a:0 "The Equestrians won't know who to trust when VOPS is through with them."

changelings.17.t:0 "[EQS.GetName] Has Destroyed Our Spy Network!"
changelings.17.d:0 "The Great Imperial Nobody sat at his desk, reviewing the reports coming in from his spies, or at least, the ones that could send reports. The infiltration had worked for a time, and it had worked wonderfully. Noling could deny that. But eventually, the Equestrians developed their own means of detecting changelings, and ever since then, Vaspier had watched as his spy network began to disintegrate. He'd lost two score infiltrators to Equestrian counterespionage, and it wasn't long after that that he had to give the order to stand down and cease operations. Infiltrators were expensive to train, and it took months to complete their training; they were too valuable a resource to squander fruitlessly. Those that could, he'd instructed to continue small-scale espionage and report back any findings he came across, while others he instructed to go to ground or return to changeling lines. Maybe in the future, VOPS would be able to mount another massive infiltration operation, but for now, the Hives would have to be satisfied with what VOPS had managed to accomplish. He only hoped those brutes in the Heer hadn't squandered all the hard work that had gone into gathering intel and exploiting Equestrian weaknesses."
changelings.17.a:0 "Many infiltrators died to bring us this information."

changelings.181.t:0 "A Hearth's Warming Miracle"
equestria.181.d:0 "Recently, as Hearth's Warming celebrations were in full swing in one particularly-beleagured part of the front line, an entire platoon of Equestrian soldiers disappeared. The mistake was discovered in the evening, and a team of special forces was dispatched to track them down. In the early hours of the next day, the team returned with only four of the missing soldiers in tow, and told quite the story.\n\nAccording to them, they discovered that, in a spur-of-the-moment decision, the platoon left their defensive positions in an attempt to invite the opposing changelings to the celebrations. They were beaten, tied up, and stripped for their trouble. From there, the changelings, who had been hit just as hard by the fighting, reacted somewhat differently to the strain of war. They had half of the platoon butchered and eaten, and the other half sent to other parts of the front lines for the same purpose. The special forces team also reported the changelings dressing up as the dead Equestrians to hold mocking plays. As proof, they showed uniforms of some of the missing soldiers that they had picked up while infiltrating the camp. This might sound like an outrageous tale, but the story was mirrored by the ones given by the rescued soldiers, who were seemingly kept alive so that they could be consumed later.\n\nThe special forces team who mounted this daring and miraculous rescue will be given medals, naturally, but the sad fact is that they only validated a rumor that has been swirling around since the start of the war. Equestrian propaganda barely needs to act at all. Extreme anti-changeling rhetoric is increasingly normal.\n\nThe unusual part is that, using secret channels, the Changeling state has expressed a desire to keep this hidden from their own soldiers, as this was a direct violation of a Queen's Decree about handling prisoners. They consider this a disciplinary issue, and do not want their own forces to think it's acceptable behavior to the extent that they are already preparing to punish the involved parties. They have requested that Equestria not push the issue, citing that it will be harder for them to keep this behavior rare if their soldiers are constantly getting reminded of it."
changelings.181.a:0 "This is so gross..."
changelings.181.b:0 "Can there ever be peace with these... things?"
changelings.181.c:0 "Let's see how much they like their troops."

changelings.18.t:0 "Sombra Demands Our Subjugation"
changelings.18.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis watched with raised eyebrows as the ambassador from the Crystal Empire approached her throne. She had heard the news of King Sombra's return, and as far as she was concerned, that was a good sign. Anything that weakened Equestria and its allies was good for her. "You stand in the presence of Her Royal Majesty, Great Queen Chrysalis, first of her name," Chrysalis' herald called out. "Bow your head before the queen of all the changelings and state your business."\n\nTo Chrysalis' surprise, the ambassador refused to do so, and instead cleared his throat. "Queen Chrysalis, I come bearing an ultimatum from His Imperial Majesty, King Sombra, King of Kings and Emperor of Emperors. Now that the long-awaited king has finally returned to his throne, it is only right that this continent gives him the respect he deserves. It is the King's command that you bow before him and pledge fealty as a steadfast subject, and in exchange, His Imperial Majesty offers you and your nation his eternal protection."\n\nEvery changeling in the room bristled at the bold demands, and none more so than Chrysalis herself. "Me? Pledge loyalty to a ghost?!" She snarled at the ambassador. "The Queen of the Changelings bows to nobody, least of all a pony!"\n\n"If you do not kneel before His Imperial Majesty, then he will respond with military force, and your pathetic nation will be crushed before his armies, like so many others before you. It is your choice whether you would embrace his friendship, or suffer his wrath.""
changelings.18.a:0 "The only thing Sombra will be getting from the changelings is your body stuffed in a box!"
changelings.18.b:0 "We do not wish to come to blows with King Sombra. We will yield to his rule."

changelings.19.t:0 "Sombra Offers An Alliance!"
changelings.19.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis watched with raised eyebrows as the ambassador from the Crystal Empire approached her throne. She had heard the news of King Sombra's return, and as far as she was concerned, that was a good sign. Anything that weakened Equestria and its allies was good for her. "You stand in the presence of Her Royal Majesty, Great Queen Chrysalis, first of her name," Chrysalis' herald called out. "Bow your head before the queen of all the changelings and state your business."\n\nThe ambassador respectfully dipped his head. It wasn't a full bow, but it was good enough for relations between two monarchies. "His Imperial Majesty, King Sombra, King of Kings and Emperor of Emperors, wishes to extend his hoof in an offer of friendship to the Great Queen Chrysalis of the Changeling Hives," the ambassador said. "It is in the benefits of both of our nations to forge an alliance and work in unison to see the destruction of Equestria. Our armies, working together as one, can enslave this continent beneath us. The king eagerly awaits your reply."\n\nChrysalis rubbed her hoof against her chin. An alliance with Sombra? She immediately wanted to reject on the basis that Sombra was little more than a pony, but he was more than that, wasn't he? He had powers that made him more than the average equine, and his military prowess was certainly formidable. Perhaps an alliance would be in the best interest of the Changeling Hives..."
changelings.19.a:0 "Sombra is a pony, and all ponies deserve nothing more than to be subjects of the Changeling Hives!"
changelings.19.b:0 "An alliance will work splendidly! Let us work together to toss Celestia off of her shiny mountain and kick her into the sea!"

changelings.20.t:0 "Peace Has Failed!"
changelings.20.d:0 ""And so it is clear that there is no choice but to have war! Not just war, but a war that swallows the whole nation, and then the world!" Queen Chrysalis stood at the head of Marble Field in front of 30,000 soldiers. She had been giving a grandiose speech for the last... however long. All she knew was that doing this at night sucked, doing it with all the searchlights arranged around the field to make a grand set of light walls made it worth it, and she was nearing the end.\n\n"I know that you all wish to cleave, remove, square off against, burn, cleanse, battle, attack, and smash the ponies by the hundreds with vicious abandon. You do not even need to ask! Our great revenge will see us trampling over their retreating forms as we rush ever onwards towards the final victory! We do not want peace, and neither should they! They will understand the peace they have earned when we prove that we can erect a new hive built out of their dead!"\n\nThe floodgates broke. There were scattered screams in the crowd that, in a frightening display of discipline, harmonized into one single, all-encompassing, ground-shaking, body-felt chant: "Sieg heil! Sieg heil!" as the mass thrust its limbs into the air in perfect salutes. \n\nFrom atop her podium, Chrysalis had some fear in the back of her mind. Fanaticism like this was hard to control, and control it she would have to after victory. But from where she was standing, basking in the glow of her army's perfect adoration and sublime oneness, feeling their rage echo throughout her form, she could only think of one thing..."
changelings.20.a:0 "It's a great feeling!"

changelings.21.t:0 "Lovely Shadows"
changelings.21.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis sighed as she sifted through the stack of papers requiring her attention. This was the part of monarchy she hated: paperwork. No matter what she did, no matter how she tried to escape it, it always found a way to torment her. Perhaps the grunts in her armies had it the best; she much rather would have been fighting in the trenches than scribbling her signature over and over again behind a desk.\n\nAs she shifted a stack of papers, however, a simple envelope fell out. Quirking a brow, Chrysalis picked up the letter and deftly ripped it open with her magic. Inside was a hoofwritten note from King Sombra, and Chrysalis blinked in surprise as she read it over:\n\n"Fairest Queen of the Changeling Hives, I have long had my eye on you. As you surely know, the continuation of a monarchy requires the production of an heir, and only a king is fit to marry a queen of your stature. And you, Chrysalis, are finer than the finest of crystals. Let us bind our two nations together in more ways than one; let us bind them together just as we bind ourselves together as husband and wife. I eagerly await your response.\nSombra"\n\nChrysalis blinked, a fluster beginning to build in her cheeks. Her eyes darted between the letter, the wastebasket, and the pen sitting on her desk. What did she do? Did she toss his letter away and ignore it... or should she instead write a reply?"
changelings.21.a:0 "I never thought I'd settle down and get married, but there's a first for everything."
changelings.21.b:0 "I'm going to pretend I never got this letter and hope that's the end of it."

changelings.32.d:0 "The radios were alive with covert transmissions from Vaspier's spies. VOPS infiltrators, together with changeling Jaegers, had successfully managed to infiltrate the Equestrian lines. Now, after weeks of preparations and clandestine weapons drops behind the Equestrian army, the infiltrators were ready to strike. Just minutes ago, Vaspier read the confirmation that the saboteurs were ready to strike. And with the Heer already squaring off against the ponies, there was no time like the present. Folding up the report, Vaspier picked up the phone receiver on his desk and spun the dial. He waited until he heard the click of the phone being connected to its destination. "Zero hour is a go," he said into the receiver, and he set it back down. Within seconds, he knew the saboteurs would be moving out to their assignments. All he had to do now was sit back and wait for confirmation of their success."

changelings.36.t:0 "Ditrysium Naval Effort"
changelings.36.d:0 "Building ships is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. Unlike a rifle which can be assembled by a single drone, or a tank which is neatly fabricated and welded together by a few changelings in a factory, a ship is practically a town floating on the sea. It takes the efforts of countless dockyards and factories working together to assemble the ship, piece by piece, over weeks of hard work. Ditrysium is the largest of our dockyards and our greatest port, and even it is struggling to keep up with the demands of our navies. Queen Helvia has petitioned Queen Chrysalis for more funding and resources to expand the dockyards and supply the navy with the ships it desperately needs. Unfortunately, the resources we can set aside for Ditrysium cannot do both. We can either expand the dockyards to gain more ships in the long run, or dedicate the resources that could be used to construct those dockyards to instead bolster the construction of our ships, giving us more in the short term. What shall we tell Queen Helvia?"
changelings.36.a:0 "Construct more dockyards!"
changelings.36.b:0 "Produce more ships!"

changelings.37.t:0 "Vraks Factories"
changelings.37.d:0 "Queen Argynnis has recently sent a petition to Vesalipolis, asking for more resources from Queen Chrysalis to bolster the production of equipment greatly needed by our armies. While the industries of Vraks have relentlessly churned out gun after gun and tank after tank, Queen Argynnis argues that Vraks could produce even more were she given the resources she needed to expand its industry. We have a certain amount of funding set aside that we could dedicate to improved military production, and Queen Argynnis will certainly see this money. We, however, have a say in how she uses it. Shall we order the queen to focus on long term investments and use the money to build more factories, or should she focus on the short term and focus on increasing production for as long as the money lasts?"
changelings.37.a:0 "Build more factories!"
changelings.37.b:0 "Increase the output of production!"

changelings.39.t:0 "Changeling Hives Demilitarised"
changelings.39.d:0 "The Great War is over, and countless changelings and ponies lie dead. In the peace negotiations Equestria has seen fit the newly installed administration of the northern changeling hives and surrounding territory once ruled by Queen Chrysalis shall be turned into a puppet of the Equestrian government. Among other stipulations it specifies that the Changelings shall have no independent military, all troops shall be under the direct command of the Equestrian generalship, and that their justice system and paramilitary forces will have to take orders from Equestrian advisors hoof selected by Canterlot for their moral character and bureaucratic acumen. It is hoped that these conditions, among others, will prevent another war from ever occurring. However, even now there are those in Canterlot itself who say that this peace treaty will only be remembered the prelude to an even grander and more deadly conflict."
changelings.39.a:0 "They should be thanking us!"

changelings.40.t:0 "Changelings Request Remilitarisation"
changelings.40.d:0 "With the ongoing war Canterlot has received a request from King Thorax to remilitarise [From.GetNameDef]. In the letter he claims that the Changelings and all other creatures living in the northern land could be a great asset to Equestria in their war if they were finally given an independent military organization again. The letter was met by mixed feelings by the general staff. Some claim that giving the Changelings their own command is just asking for the horrors of the Great War to repeat themselves, but this time on a second front. Others say that the general staff is already overworked managing all of Equestria's divisions, armies, army groups, and theaters, and that [From.GetNameDef] taking over some of the load would be a good help."
changelings.40.a:0 "It's still too soon after the last war to be thinking about that."
changelings.40.b:0 "It's time for the Changeling to take up the peaked cap once more."

changelings.41.t:0 "Equestrians Reject Remilitarisation Plan"
changelings.41.d:0 "Despite our carefully worded message to [From.Capital.GetName] and the current situation the Equestrian government has declined our request for an independent command. It looks like we'll have to continue to rely on them for our defense. We can only hope that defense lasts, for otherwise the despair of rejection shall give way to the stench of death."
changelings.41.a:0 "It's okay, we're used to it."

changelings.42.t:0 "Equestrians Approve Remilitarisation Plan"
changelings.42.d:0 "Thanks to our carefully worded message [From.Capital.GetName] has seen fit to approve our remilitarisation plan. Our forces can now be commanded by their own generals, and recruitment can begin in earnest now. Their first task will be just getting on their four hooves, but after that they must go and help the Equestrians in their war. We shall soon earn our freedom, and help save the world!"
changelings.42.a:0 "A true true friend helps a friend in need."

CHN_demand_remilitarization:0 "Propose Remilitarisation"
CHN_demand_remilitarization_desc:0 "With Equestria currently engaged in war an opportunity arises for us to gain a measure of freedom ahead of schedule. We shall propose remilitarising [Root.GetNameDef] for the purpose of assisting them when at war in a carefully worded letter. Hopefully the Equestrian government will accept the proposal."

changelingattache.1.t:0 "Chrysalis Recalls Attaché"
changelingattache.1.d:0 "'Because of internal matters within the Changeling Lands the scientists, soldiers, advisors, and all related personnel of the Changeling-Griffonian Expeditionary Mission are hereby ordered to return home at once by the decree of Queen Chrysalis.'\nThe message is simple, written in a taciturn dialect of the language the two distant nations share, yet profound in its meaning. For years the changelings assisting the Imperial Army and attached research divisions have become a staple of life for those in the upper echelons of the command hierarchy, and now it is time for them to leave. The mood is unsurprisingly somber when the message is read aloud, both for what leaving means and for what awaits the changelings in their homeland.\nSynovial, senior military commander of the mission, seems relieved at the news, as if a great weight had been lifted off his wings. His compatriot, Thranx, seems to have had the opposite reaction, falling into a depressive stupor that in turn lowers the mood of all those near him. The differing reactions have prompted one of the Imperial commanders who worked with the CGEM to voice the idea that they should throw a party for all the members of the mission to wish them fond farewells, for it would seem to be kind to let their last memories of the Griffonian Empire be happy ones."
changelingattache.1.a:0 "Let's not make a fuss about this and send them off with stoicism."
changelingattache.1.b:0 "A farewell party sounds like just the thing!"

changelingattache.2.t:0 "A Farewell Party to Remember"
changelingattache.2.d:0 "The night is young when the changeling members of the Changeling-Griffonian Expeditionary Mission arrive at the Imperial Palace in Griffenheim for their grand farewell party. There are hundreds of them, and hundreds more griffons that seek to attend the party as well. Luckily for all those involved, when the capital was first moved from Griffonstone to Griffenheim the designers of the new Imperial Palace's grand ballroom had capacity first in mind.\n\nThe party ends up lasting well into the early dawn hours, with many an event to be seen. Scientists exchanged last minute notes while reminiscing about strange discoveries. A noblegriff actually managed to impersonate a changeling colonel, and soldiers of both species broke out into song over large flaggons of beer. Fun was had by all, and somecreature was even able to get Thranx to smile again.\n\nDuring the party though it seems that [GRI.GetLeader] overheard Imperial Army soldiers wishing their Changeling friends that they could help them out or even fight alongside them in whatever struggle awaited them back home. This would lead to a review of supplies and troop strength in the morrow. Theoretically, the proposal could be done, but it also could just be written off as an alcohol-induced hallucination.\n\nIn any case, this night will long be remembered as the rowdiest party in memory, and a true bright spot on the record of Imperial affairs."
changelingattache.2.a:0 "We wish our friends well in their journey home."
changelingattache.2.b:0 "When they go back they should take a thousand or five tons of supplies."

changelingattache.3.c:0 "Friends don't let friends fight alone! We'll send who we can back with them!"

changelingattache.4.t:0 "A Plea for Asylum"
changelingattache.4.d:0 "Following the ordered return of the Changeling military mission back to Vesalipolis, General Thranx has now approached none other than [GRI.GetLeader], begging them to let him stay in the Empire.\nThey were immediately caught within the crossfire of other nobles and advisors. Some argued for this, saying that he would be invaluable to our nation in continued service, as well as to his status as a friend to our nation. Others argued against this plea for asylum, with the major contention being that the Changeling state was also a fried to our nation, that they would take it very poorly if suddenly we publicly aided a deserter of theirs, and that their state has no restraint when it comes to matters such as revenge. At the end, however, the result was entirely up to the ruling griffon themselves.\nAs Thranx broke down in tears before them, a choice had to be made."
changelingattache.4.a:0 "We will not abandon our friends!"
changelingattache.4.b:0 "He must do as his Queen commands."

changelingattache.5.t:0 "Traitor General"
changelingattache.5.d:0 "Your majesty, we have bad news coming from the Griffonian Empire.\nIt appears that one of our military commanders who was part of the Expeditionary Mission, General Thranx, has refused to heed your wise and reasonable order to return home! Apparently, the thought of doing the service he promsed caused him to break down into tears openly and beg [GRI.GetLeader] for political asylum. Yet more shocking is that they accepted!\nMy Queen, this is outrageous. We must see these traitors punished!"
changelingattache.5.a:0 "Let's be reasonable at first."

changelingattache.6.t:0 "Chrysalis Demands Thranx to be Returned Home"
changelingattache.6.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis of the changelings has issued a very vocal diplomatic protest, laden with grandiose language, appeals to our years of cooperation, and thinly-veiled threats, on our decision to shelter General Thranx within the Empire. She now calls for us to return him home at once, so that she, as his rightful Queen, can deal with him and his treacherous dealings accordingly.\nThranx has proven to be a good, valuable friend to us, and he appreciates our help and support. But... is he worth the trouble we risk in continuing to shelter him?"
changelingattache.6.a:0 "Never! He will stay!"
changelingattache.6.b:0 "We mustn't risk trouble with the Queen."

changelingattache.7.t:0 "The Firing Squad"
changelingattache.7.d:0 "Today, just as the sun began to rise, General Thranx arrived at Vesalipolis. In chains, naturally. He was escorted through the grand hive, taunted and insulted by many of the other changelings along the way. When he was brought to the Queen, the disgust on her face sealed the fate of the young General. No less than 20 minutes after his arrival at Vesalipolis, he was blindfolded, and Field Marshal Trimmel himself commanded the firing squad. A loud bang echoed throughout the hive, and Thranx was no more."
changelingattache.7.a:0 "What did he expect?"

changelingattache.8.t:0 "Griffonian Response"
changelingattache.8.d:0 "To our great shock, the imperial nobility, including [GRI.GetLeader], have declined our demand to return General Thranx to us. This betrayal is unbelievable, and will not go unpunished!\nHowever, first we must let the Queen know of this..."
changelingattache.8.a:0 "The queen will be most displeased..."

changelingattache.9.t:0 "Chrysalis Swears Revenge"
changelingattache.9.d:0 "The Queen gnarled aloud as she listened to the changeling in front of her who relayed the Griffonian response to her. With a swift stroke and blast from her crooked horn, a bright wave of energy flowed throughout the room, knocking many to the ground. Then she just stood there, deathly still for a few seconds, before speaking.\n"I nearly forgot that we are not allowed to have friends of other races, or else we will be the ones who are abandoned. Well! If their spine has finally grown in so that they may stab their allies in the back for daring to help them, then so be it! They will learn how we deal with traitors! And for the rest of you, remember that the red-bloods hate us, always have and always will, and that these are the wages of helping them in return!"\nThe other changelings present applauded and cheered for their Queen."
changelingattache.9.a:0 "We have no need for cooperation."
changelingattache.9.b:0 "Let's repay their betrayal."

changelingattache.10.t:0 "Revenge of the Queen"
changelingattache.10.d:0 "It all appeared to be a perfectly normal day, today. For the most part.\nGeneral Thranx had used the time in Griffonia and away from other changelings to better incorporate himself into the life of a griffon. Often times he had used his shapeshifting abilities to 'fit in', but many griffons, especially those who had previously worked with him, respected and liked him either way, no matter the appearance.\nThranx has even gone so far as finding a lover that lived just outside of the capital. It was all too perfect, it seemed, and the lone Changeling appeared to be in good claws.\nThat was nothing but a ruse though, it seems. Earlier today, during a visit at a restaurant, Thranx began to cough heavily, and shortly after collapsed to the ground. Griffons nearby immediately rushed to his rescue, seeing him cough up blood, but it was no use. General Thranx... died.\nA funeral has already been organised for this brave changeling, and he has been issued griffonian citizenship post-mortem to thank him for the appreciation he shared for our nation and culture.\nShockingly though, police has found out that the cause of Thranx death was a deadly poison, one that has never been seen or used in all of Griffonia before. In addition, his fiancée is nowhere to be found following his death. Could this be the work of a fellow changeling, sent by Chrysalis? For now, we are unsure."
changelingattache.10.a:0 "Rest in peace, friend."

changelingattache.11.t:0 "Best Served With Wine"
changelingattache.11.d:0 "Fantastic news reached us from Griffonia today, my Queen! The devilish traitor, General Thranx, has been killed by one of our infiltrators today!\nIt appears that Thranx had tried to fit into the Griffonian society. So much, in fact, that he tried to seek out a lover. Our infiltrator used this opportunity to charm and get near him, and later poisoned his drink while they were eating at a restaurant. The infiltrator managed to flee the scene before anyone could catch onto him."
changelingattache.11.a:0 "The traitor is dead, at last."

changelingattache.12.t:0 "The Griffonian Empire Sends Volunteers"
changelingattache.12.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, our contribution to the CGEM returned home with thousands of griffon soldiers in tow. Their commander says that they are volunteers from the Empire, here to return the favour and foster the bonds of friendship that bind our two nations.\n\nQueen Chrysalis seemed visibly confused at the news,but made no attempt to turn back the volunteers. Throughout the Wehrmacht, the soldiers are now having uses found for their talents, being of another race and culture, and many changelings have publically wished to be partnered with the "fellow meat-eaters, even if they are foreigners". The Queen's Tower has requested they not refer to allies as such in the future."
changelingattache.12.a:0 "Our friends are only an ocean away!"
changelingattache.12.a_tt:0 "Spawns §YTwo Imperial Volunteers Divisions§!\n"

changelingattache.13.t:0 "Orders from the Queen"
changelingattache.13.d:0 "The Queen has issued the return of the Changeling-Griffonian Expeditionary Mission, including the two commanders, General Thranx and Marshal Synovial. She believes there is no need for the mission anymore, seeing as how changeling efforts would best be off directed entirely on Equestria."
changelingattache.13.a:0 "At once my queen!"

changelingattache.14.t:0 "The Fatherland Calls"
changelingattache.14.t_annex:0 "Soldiers Without Home"
changelingattache.14.d:0 "Evening had fallen over Griffenheim, the gas lamps of the city lightning up the streets as the last few shops closed up for the day. Two changelings in full military uniform sat at a café, slowly sipped a cup of coffee each, taking in the majesty of the city, looking out on the plaza besides them. It had been a long time since they had arrived in the city, but nonetheless, their usual place, the Café Central always provided the best coffee and view. At least one a lot better than anything you could get in Vesalipolis. \nOne of the changelings, eyes a bright blue began talking as he lit up a cigarette "Been a long time since we heard from Her Majesty. From what Der Bürger says, the war must be going badly, Synoval"\n"Thranx, I trust that these are merely some kind of propaganda from the Ponies. Before long, we will be invited to gala in Canterlot," Synoval answered, pouring a spoonful of sugar into the coffee, before stirring it around.\nThranx took another sip of his coffee"I don't know really. The telegraph speaks of the same. Bombardment on Vesalipolis, pushed back from Hjortland. If anything, I would suspect the Palace of keeping us in the dark."\n"Think so? You really think they would keep us in the dark?" Synoval deadpanned.\n"Yes. We are only here on a voluntary basis because of the war back home," Thranx said as he pulsed on the cigarette, enjoying the goods available in the Empire.\n"And yet, if we wanted to go home, we could just grab the first postal plane out of here. It's not like they will take offense," Synoval said, not noticing the waiter coming up behind them.\n"Sirs? There's a person on the phone for you. It's from the Changeling Embassy. They say it's urgent," He said, pointing with his left claw towards the bar.\nSynoval and Thranx rose from the table. "It seems like our duty calls," Thranx sighed as he put a few coins on the table, walking up to the phone on the bar with Synoval in tow. He picked up the reciever and listened closely.\nThe tired and frantic voice in the reciever stammered out a few words before hanging up "Vesalipolis fallen...total collapse...all officers recalled to the homeland to fight against the Equestrian menace."\nThranx dropped the reciever, looking towards Synoval, with a blank look.\n"Well, what did they say?" Synoval asked, probably somewhat cognizant of the message Thranx had just recieved.\nThranx muttered as the words replayed in his head. "The homeland has fallen. We must journey back to do our duty against the Equestrians."\nWith that, the Changeling presence in the Empire left, ready to travel home to fight on the fronts once more."
changelingattache.14.d_annex:0 "The front pages of newspapers across Griffonia all bore the same headline today, "Changelings issue unconditional surrender, peace in Equestria".\nThe Changeling embassy in Griffenheim confirmed the news, before admitting that their contact with the homeland was now completely cut off. With the Changeling military disintegrating and the future of the entire country up in the air, the question of what to do with the Changeling military mission within the Empire has presented itself. They are now Changelings with no nation, serving under a command that no longer exists.\nThe Changelings of the Expedition have adapted well to Griffonia, with many having absorbed Griffonian customs over the many years they have been present in Griffenheim. Granting them Griffonian citizenship and letting them stay would certainly be an option. Their expertise in warfare has been invaluable in modernizing our military. Thranx, in particular, has made it very clear that he would prefer things to continue as they had before.\nAlternatively, we could simply send them on their way, leaving them whatever fate has in store for them. Whatever our decision, there is no need to worry about attracting the ire of Chrysalis anymore."
changelingattache.14.a:0 "Anyone can deal with victory. Only the mighty can bear defeat."
changelingattache.14.b:0 "We may as well let them stay."
changelingattache.14.c:0 "We shouldn't risk a potential diplomatic incident further down the line."

changelingattache.15.t:0 "Disaster in the Upper City"
changelingattache.15.d:0 "Tragedy struck today as a high-class restaraunt in the Palatial region of Griffenheim was the site of a terrorist attack. Dozens were left vomting on the ground and fighting for their lives as unknown assailants snuck a slow-acting poison into the kitchen's water system the night before, causing every meal eaten over the course of the day to be contaminated. As of yet, over a dozen have died, including some minor nobility, while nearly a hundred have been hospitalized. Most of the worst victims have been children and the elderly, who's bodies couldn't handle the poison.\nThe most notable death is General Thranx, who was dining at the establishment in the morning and reacted both far differently and far worse to the poison used, as if it was aimed at him and the rest were incidental. Adding to the intrique is that he was dining there along his local fiance, who witnesses claim lost her appetite once she arrived and didn't eat, and who has not been seen since she arrived home after the pair were done. Rumors abound that this was a scheme by the Changeling government to punish the general for his desertion, and to punish the rest of the nation for aiding and abetting him in it. These rumors have been supported by the official response by the Changeling government, which was, quote, "It is good that the traitor is dead. Hopefully the Empire has learned what happens when they decide their allies are a burden the instant it becomes legal to avail themselves of them."\nThis audacious response to the harboring of the good General Thranx is currently being discussed in the halls of Griffenheim, although what can be done besides to deal with this and move on is unknown. As the Changeling government also said, "We were allies until recently, so we do not have any Griffonian traitors for the Empire to kill in retribution, for which we apologize deeply.""

The traitor, General Thranx, has been killed by one of our infiltrators today!\nIt appears that Thranx had tried to fit into the Griffonian society. So much, in fact, that he tried to seek out a lover. Our infiltrator used this opportunity to charm and get near him, and convinced him to go to a restaraunt where she had poisoned all of the food. He has succumbed, as have many other griffons, and in a wonderful twist of fate, the griffons of status were all ones who supported the decision to harbor Thranx! They will not trifle with us again!"
changelingattache.16.a:0 "If only they hadn't done it the first time..."

changelingattache.17.t:0 "Changlings Banned from Trinitarianism!"
changelingattache.17.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader] In light of the recent attack by the changelings against the Griffonian Empire's civilian population as revenge for harboring a refugee general, the Archons of Trinitarianism have declared that, henceforth, all changelings are banned from participating in the faith in any official capacity. Any changeling who is discovered to have a rank within the churches shall be removed, and priests who know they are serving a changeling must turn them away. This affects most conventional worshippers, but numerous churches to smaller deities have followed suit.\nIt is unknown if this will directly affect any changelings, or if it will directly affect anyone at all, but the Archons felt it was important to make sure now that their church remains "undefiled by the chitinous menace"."
changelingattache.17.a:0 "It had to happen eventually."

changelings.44.t:0 "Envoy to [PLB.GetName]"
changelings.44.d:0 "Sitting along our northeastern borders lie the loosely-organized holdings of the bear nation. [PLB.GetName] is hardly what anyling could call a nation; it lacks a unified economy and consists of scattered tribes united under [PLB.GetLeader], barely able to support a modern industrial base. They are weak and small, and as such, they should naturally fear us, the strongest nation in the region.\n\nYet diplomacy does not need to fail immediately. What the bears lack in industry, they make up for in other ways. The gold reserves of the bears would go a long way toward strengthening our economy, freeing up funds that could be used elsewhere. Alternatively, the bears have deposits of steel that could be useful in bolstering our military production, should we gain access to them. On top of that, we could seize the bordering states with the bears, putting them under our direct control, giving us access to the industry and citizens inside of these lands. Any demand, should the bears cave, will be a boon to us moving forward. In return, we will offer the bears military protection and the guidance of our scientists and engineers.\n\nWhat shall we demand of [PLB.GetName]?"
changelings.44.a:0 "We demand your gold reserve."

Nonetheless, Thorax's ideas are a minority in the Hives and he is mostly despised by the Hive Queens, who see his vision as detrimental to the changelings as whole. That has changed after the Changelings' defeat in the Great War, and now Thorax leads the reformed nation into a bright future, hoping to show the world that they're not all monsters."

[PLB.GetLeader] rejected all of these demands as outlandish, saying that the bears would never bow before brutes and bullies, and if the changelings wanted those concessions so badly, they would have to come and take them.\n\nNaturally, a response from Chrysalis didn't take long, and changeling troops crossed the border in a full scale invasion. Bear defences quickly collapsed, and an armistice was signed the following day. With most of the bears retreating to safer lands, a new government was installed under the leadership of a bear known as Björnling, who is, by all accounts, known to be a fascist sympathiser."

However, the bears of the north held their breath and prayed that the concessions they gave the Changeling Hives would be enough.\n\nIt seemed as if nothing would come out of this, but a week later, a series of raids and skirmishes began on the Changeling-Bear border, resulting in the devastation of numerous bear villages and many civilian casualties. The bear leadership, knowing that this could escalate into a full scale invasion, have agreed to the initial changeling demands, wishing to preserve their independence."

Much of the bears' iron and gold reserves have been moved out of the country towards Vesalipolis, fuelling the future changeling war effort.

changelings.59.d:0 "The Secret Police of Vesalipolis, Ditrysium, Volistad, Lyctida, Sicarus, Phantine and every other Changeling hive worth mentioning have begun an operation to pull out the Harmonic foreign influence by the hair. After months of infiltration and information-gathering, the fruit was borne in scalding gas and machine gun screeches. From dusk until dawn, the whole of the nation echoed with the screams of modern staffs of death, as a political reunion took place with the sole aim to wipe the Thoraxians out of reality. Hive police, military police, Imperial police, and the Queen's Guard kicked in door after door, exterminating any who resisted and reducing the survivors to fresh heads on fence-posts. The Heer stalked the fields, flushing them from their caves and hideouts with flamethrowers, grenades, and tanks, in order to massacre the rabble as they fled. Hundreds of our officers fell, but the enemy was butchered by the tens of thousands. Through methods doubtless beyond the understanding of the common citizen, the Prandialists joined in the purge before declaring support for the Queen, and even the Black Generation closed its doors to fleeing Thoraxians.\n\nAs the sun rose the next morning, there was much work to be done. The dead leaders had their remains paraded through town to cheering crowds to the site of the public execution of those still living. The remains of bodies of ponies who had helped out the Thoraxians were categorized and determined to be nearly all Stalliongradian, and the report was summarily buried in favor of calling them Equestrians. The rest were donated to the poorhouses and shelters of the nation, so that they could at least give something back as a corpse.\n\nDisappointingly, the arch-traitor kept the best escape routes for himself, and fled with his remaining benefactors to parts unknown as one of the few survivors."

changelings.61.t:0 "Grand Military Parade In Vesalipolis"
changelings.61.d:0 "Today the streets of the hive-city of Vesalipolis were filled to the brim with changelings, with many buzzing above in the air. They had all gathered to spectate a huge military parade, which had been prepared and advertised for weeks. Changelings had come from all across the nation, and even the other four Hive Queens were present. It was, apart from Queen Chrysalis' coronation as Great Queen of the Changeling Hegemony, the largest parade the city had ever seen.\n\nIn the square, columns of changeling soldiers dressed in grey soon emerged out of their barracks, marching with synchronized steps and waving their white banners. As they marched, the civilians greeted them with cheers and admired their discipline. Behind them, shiny new Panzers rolled out, with Hivesmarshall Trimmel leading the long column of a hundred tanks. They were followed by motorized divisions in their trucks, artillery battalions with their wheeled guns, marines, sailors, elite Jaeger squadrons, Queen's Guard, and more. It was an endless stream of soldiers armed to the brim with the newest weaponry. The audience was left in awe and convinced of the might of their nation, their belief in the salvation Queen Chrysalis promised them stronger than ever.\n\nAt the end of the column came Chrysalis herself, riding in an officer's car and dressed in a snow-white military uniform. She saluted the crowd and the crowd saluted her, chanting "Long live the Queen!" almost fanatically. And as she rode, roaring fighters and bombers appeared in the sky and blotted out the sun.\n\nThis was just the beginning. Soon, the soldiers and their weapons of war would be turned toward all of the Hegemony's enemies, and one by one, those nations would fall and become nothing more than sources of love for the changeling species."
changelings.61.a:0 "Glory to the Changeling Queendom!"

changelings.63.t:0 "The Hunt for Thorax"
changelings.63.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis stormed into VOPS headquarters in the foulest mood she had been in in a very, very long time. She did not even look at the masses of changeling pencil-pushers that made up the main body of the organization, knowing full well that her only goal was to get to Vaspier Orn Kladisium, the most important nobody in the country. She knocked on the door to his unassuming office, then magically bashed it in.\n\nVaspier was staring at her with rapt attention. He already knew what this was about, and his perpetual fake smile was heavy on his face for it. "We already have most of our resources aimed at the arch-traitor, my Queen", he said to cut her off. It was a futile gesture.\n\n"Damn right you do! Now explain why his head isn't on my desk already, you dumpster-diving buffoon!" The Queen shouted back with the fury of a thousand hives.\n\nVaspier took the slightest pause. He knew the answer, and that it was entirely his fault. "...He was tipped off. By someone in this organization."\n\n"Really? There were Thoraxian harmonists in this organization? The one tasked with FINDING AND EXTERMINATING EVERY LAST TRAITOROUS HARMONIST IN THIS NATION? It's a good thing it's only the secret police that have been corrupted! At least you know better than dumping Thoraxian assassins in my bedchamber!" She took a second to breathe. The anger was making it hard for her to talk properly. \n\nVaspier spoke up. "There's a limited number of places he could go. We have the bulk of our agents moving to try and head him off. We'll get him, you have my word. Speaking of which, have you thought of the perfect method yet?" Vaspier smiled hard back, changing the subject. He knew the answer from her face, but he wanted to know the exact method.\n\n"Indeed. If he wants to be a pony so much, then I don't think he needs that carapace. And Dieter can work miracles with the right knives... wouldn't that be a fun spectation?" At the thought of that, Vaspier's smile turned real for a brief second."
changelings.63.a:0 "As you say, Your Majesty."

changelings.64.t:0 "Stage Magic"
changelings.64.d:0 "Recently, a Changeling refugee by the name of Thorax entered our protective custody. He was the leader of the last major rebel movement within the Changeling Lands ever since the remainder sided with the Queen against him (interestingly), and was forced to flee during the purge of said movement, which was reportedly quite violent. He escaped with the help of "foreign backers", and through the sacrifice of a body double, and has now come here to ask us to show his remaining followers that he is still alive, and possibly to influence his home nation directly.\n\nNormally, we would deny this request flat-out. Supporting rebels in this way has been a big no-go ever since the Prandial Wars, where our support only spread the problem around rather than turn it into a solution. However, the Changeling state has attempted to use that body double to try and trick everyone into thinking that Thorax is dead entirely. Showing that he is alive now can throw a colossal wrench into their plans, and do serious damage to the credibility of the regime, which currently hates us.\n\nThe downside is that, as mentioned, the regime already hates us, and as they killed his body double by tearing off his carapace and broadcasting his screams live, they hate Thorax even more. If we reveal that Thorax is alive and in our custody, they will not take it well.\n\nBut there's another dimension: Thorax is a Harmonist, and seems to be a real one this time. So are his remaining followers. It is our goal to try and spread Harmony throughout the world, and here is one case where it has spread itself, and we have the option to keep it from being snuffed out as a sapling."
changelings.64.a:0 "We must help a friend in need."
changelings.64.b:0 "We won't risk our ponies in their internal politics!"

changelings.65.t:0 ""It's not him""
changelings.65.d:0 ""What do you mean it's not him?" Queen Chrysalis asked. She had seen him get dragged down here, and it very clearly was Thorax. The VOPS officers who bravely pulled him from his entourage just before he escaped to the Crystal City's inner sphere, they said it was him.\n\n"I mean, it's not him. It's a body double. I don't know why his owners thought it was a good idea to do that for a changeling, but we've walked right into it." Dieter finished cleaning the blood off of his knife and put it on the nearby cart.\n\n Chrysalis was furious. "This is a disaster! How am I going to get my spectation now?"\n\nDieter remained cool, or at least not unusually miserable. "Well, if he's close enough to fool us until we put him under torture, he's close enough to fool the cameras. Hence, why this normally isn't done. I say we execute him as Thorax anyways."\n\n There was a pause as Chrysalis tried to wrap her brain around that. "Wha... but... wait, that WORKS?" It was a brutally direct solution, but seemed foolproof.\n\n"Probably. Since the real one was headed to the Crystal Empire, he's probably in Equestria right now, and they should know better than to admit to harboring a terrorist leader. If they do, we just pretend that they're the ones lying, since they definitely won't give him over for proof... Oh, and while you're here, the VOPS auditing team is ready."\n\nThe queen thought about the question. That was an oddly charitable interpretation of Equestria's relations with the state, but if it did indeed work out that way..."
changelings.65.a:0 "The nation wants blood, and frankly, so do I."
changelings.65.b:0 "Equestria has been getting more antagonistic. Just focus on VOPS."

changelings.66.t:0 "Enjoy the Show"
changelings.66.d:0 "Bound and gagged, "Thorax" was marched onto the stage and chained to an upright pole. In attendance were Her Majesty Queen Chrysalis, Captain of the Queen's Guard and Vhy Dieter Heinrich, and somewhere in the audience, Vaspier orn Kladisium, representing everyone who knew the trick. Also in attendance was Hivesmarshall Trimmel, the accused's brother General Pharynx, numerous other officers and leaders, and thousands of audience members. A large radio set ensured that all would be transmitted across the nation to countless homes.\n\n"Thorax," Chrysalis called down from her seat. "You have brought shame and instability to this nation through your treason to the Equine race. On my name as Queen, I decree that the sentence is spectation, to be carried out by Captain Dieter Heinrich."\n\nThe good captain stepped down from his podium to where the imposter was restrained. He recieved a set of knives from a nearby officer, picked one out, and sighed. Torture and public appearances were things he was good at, but didn't like, and this was both. He placed the tip of the knife between the rear thigh plate and the ventral plate, and...\n\n\nExactly one hour later, "Thorax" was declared dead, much of his carapace and all of his blood on the ground around him. As promised, not even then was there the burst of fire of a changeling transforming into their true form.\n\nIn the days to follow, the Harmonists in the nation who had survived by not ever speaking up would think that this was appalling, and they would once again say nothing. Most would find it merely "a bit much". The changelings who the state news talked about were the ones who loved it."
changelings.66.a:0 "The Queen was one of those."

changelings.67.t:0 "The Response"
changelings.67.d:0 ""...And that is why I shall not rest until Chrysalis's regime of tyrants and murderers is reduced to dust!"\n\nThat was the end of a speech, delivered by radio, of the still-living Thorax. In it, he explained how he was still alive, his desire to keep up the fight, and who his new owner was. Of course, that last one wasn't said in so many words, but there was no doubt that this powerful transmission was coming from the same nation that he named.\n\nRemarkably, none of the changelings at the meeting seemed particularly upset. Queen Chrysalis's expression didn't change at all. Neither did Dieter's. Vaspier still had his trademark hollow smile. The others, mostly Vesalipolis police and civil leaders, did what they could to follow suit, but they weren't happy. After a minute of them all sitting there, the message began to play again, and Chrysalis turned the radio off.\n\nVaspier stood up. "I should probably go and fix this", he said, as if it was a minor technical error.\n\nNobody reacted until he was nearly at the door. Queen Chrysalis, without turning to look at him, said, "You aren't thinking big enough."\n\nVaspier stopped, before saying, "You're right, my Queen," and leaving."
changelings.67.a:0 "I wonder what he'll come up with."

changelings.68.t:0 "VOPS Audited"
changelings.68.d:0 "In a sub-underbasement, Captain Dieter Heinrich reviewed his notes with Vaspier on the recent audit of VOPS. Though it was supposed to be independent, Dieter knew that his own report wasn't entirely correct, as Vaspier liked to keep secrets just a little too much. Still, he was comparing his incomplete version with the Nobody's doctored version to see if there were any small mistakes in the lie to pry into. \n\n"Four Thoraxians. Really."\n\nVaspier, still smiling, responded, "I might not be perfect, but I'm still the best..." Dieter immediately knew that, secretly, a number of "non-issue" harmonists and discontents had been moved out of the way. This habit was another thing that concerned him, but everyone said it wasn't worth replacing the spymaster over. "...Of course, it would have been zero if I hadn't gotten lazy with the reviews. I guess I'll be back to doing them myself."\n\nFinding no issue to raise which he hadn't already raised before, Dieter relented. "Well, I'll tell the Queen that this is all in order once again. It goes without saying, but let's not have this happen a second time."\n\n"I wouldn't worry about it", Vaspier responded, knowing how much dismissiveness like that got under the skin of the necessarily-paranoid Guard Captain."

changelings.69.d:0 "Late in the night, Vanhoover was directly struck by a series of meteors. Witnesses report bright lights coming over the horizon before getting closer, until they landed in streets and buildings, shattering windows and causing some casualties. This is odd, as meteor-sweepers found large amounts of high-grade metal scrap rather than the usual magical space-debris. Similarly, the meteors (eight in total) seem to have exploded before reaching the ground like a bomb, rather than pounding into it directly.\nFor these reasons, it is suspected that these were not meteors, but that this was a test deployment of a Changeling weapon prototype. The remains are too damaged to see, but it appears to be a self-propelled bomb launched from the south-western corner of the nation. Naturally, the Changeling state has taken credit for the "meteor shower", citing the harboring and assistance of their most-wanted. They denied that it was a weapon system, instead laying the credit with their archmages, despite this not being something changeling magic can do.\nLuckily, the weapons are very immature, and while they all managed to explode, only half hit the city, and the small payloads left one dead and fifteen injured. We do not know how many were supposed to be launched, and it's thought that this is the second attempt.\nRegardless, the prospect of it happening again and again forever has a number of economics types thoroughly irked, and they have requested that there not be a next time."

After months of buildup, Changeling forces marched across the border, where they have already begun to clash with the first line of Olenian defense. Heavy casualties are being reported, and it seems like the situation in Olenia is about to become a bloodbath. While we are not exactly sure on the reasons for war, one thing is for certain:  Olenia is in dire straits.\n\nAny offers for diplomatic intermediation from a third party have been bluntly rejected by Queen Chrysalis. She says this is a dispute between Olenia and the Changeling Lands, and will be resolved shortly. Thus, intervention from other countries is unnecessary.\n\nWe were unable to stop the outbreak of war, and now we need to decide what to do. We could either issue an official protest condemning either side for causing hostilities, or simply say nothing and stay out of the matter. It is likely that, once the changelings are done with Olenia, they will demobilize their army and remain content with what they have."

One thing is for certain, though: The changeling hives will no longer be bullied or disrespected at the table of diplomacy by the deer, or any other nation that can barely restrain their desire to see us destroyed.\n\nQueen Chrysalis has personally destroyed the diplomatic letter and reaffirmed her orders for the invasion.

CHN_DESC_TRIMMEL:0 "§YBorn§!: 17 May, 973 in Gardis\n§YRank§!: Hives' Marshall\n§YBiography§!: Born to a low level administrator of the Hive of Gardis, Trimmel Araxis du Gardis has always been destined to lead an army. Second born to his parents, he was generally viewed as the spare and allowed to choose his education as he saw fit, whereas his older sister was groomed for inheriting their dynastic position. Thus with such freedom in choice Trimmel chose the one thing he excelled at: War. At age 18 Trimmel joined the local 124th Infantry Regiment as an ensign, in 992 he was moved to begin studying at the Officer Cadet School in Vesalipolis. He graduated in November 993 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in January the following year where he was posted to various locations in Equestria after being assigned to 46th Infiltrator Brigade. He gained the attention of his superiors during the Winter Revolution, where his connection with the coordination officer was severed and he took initiative. Through an expert use of oration, trickery, and outright violence, he was able to turn his persona into a folk hero that turned the civil dispute into a civil war. After leading dozens of raids, organizing his own personal army out of vagabonds and ideologues, and throwing his personal weight behind the most uncompromising movement he could find, he masterfully disappeared with the rest of his unit. From there, he was made an upper officer immediately, and his ideas about fully utilizing Dieter's "panzer" designs ensured his promotions stayed speedy. Finally, during the 1002 Invasion, his own strategy seemed to outclass that of even Synovial, and thus the title of Hive's Marshall was transferred to him.\n§YPortrait By§!: Kam"

He simply emerged one day in 982 from the monster-infested woods of Dim Garden, already dressed in the now iconic pitch black uniform of Chrysalis's Officery, armed with the first P-00 pistol, and able to speak four languages, none of which were Changeling. Weirder still, once he could talk, he revealed that he knew things that he shouldn't. He knew the outcomes of wars that hadn't started yet, crises in governments that didn't exist yet, flaws in technology that didn't exist yet. Only five years later, in the final days of the Unification, the Prandialist splinter movement he founded joined with Queen Chrysalis as the "Vhy". During the Great Betrayal, his duties expanded as he replaced the old Guard Captain. Now, the Vhy, and the Queen's Guard it feeds, is one of the most terrible and fanatic organizations on the continent. He is also one of the most significant figures in the nation's industrial, governmental, and especially martial revolutions.\n\nBut that's not quite the whole story. To those who know him, Dieter is far less impressive than his pedigree implies. He is moody, easily-upset, and comparatively unintelligent. The secret is that his ideas are not his own: He claims they come from a past life, where he fought in a global war for the most glorious empire in the planet's history. Their relative advanvement in doctrines are what he has granted to the Queen from memory. Now that his fourty-book compendium on this history is long finished, many wonder why he is still around, both for political reasons, and personal ones.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Flake"

Vrak has managed to attain the highest merit-based rank possible in the Changeling Lands, beind a direct subordinate of Queen Chrysalis herself, all while being merely a "good" officer and a political problem.\nBorn to a drone family in the class of the "unnatural nobility" (called "capitalists" in other nations), Jachs was lucky enough to have the option of joining the officer corps instead of being shunted to the infantry as soon as the nation needed it. He learned a valuable lesson in officer school when a classmate tried to recruit him to the then-new Thoraxian cause. Jachs placed his trust in the relatively progressive Chrysalian throne, and was promptly stabbed. The secret police forgave him for the words which caused him to be singled out when he helped them find the bastard, but never forgot.\nIn 1005, Lyctida was once again engulfed in fire and blood. Jachs served adequately in putting down the Prandialist rebels and others, yet he learned much there too. He remained under watch, but his actions continued to speak louder than his words as he rose in rank with the massive expansion of the Heer, and during the war, gained some appreciation for the Equestrian ways. His seemingly boundless loyalty in spite of his arguably treasonous views has now earned him a seat besides Chrysalis herself, who sees in him a changeling who can deal with Equestrians as equals without trying to become one. It is a depressingly rare trait amount changelings, and that makes him valuable.\nBut at heart he's still a Major-General.\n§YPortrait By§!: Rich May"

CHN_DESC_RECINA:0 "§YBorn§!: July 23rd 976, in Ditrysium\n\n§YRank§!: High Admiral\n\n§YBiography§!: Recina is a curious sight among the Changeling Admiralty, being the only Royal Admiral, and a Princess at that. Hatched a few minutes too late after Queen Helvia, their mother left Recina mostly to fend for herself and focused instead on Helvia. As a result of her upbringing consisting of mostly being surrounded by drones more so than by her siblings and barely loved, Recina's physical status and magical capability are notably reduced for a Royal Changeling; so much so that she is mistaken for a Royal Male at times. Had it not been for Helvia's support and personal friendship, Recina may have wasted away as a nymph.\n\nHowever, Recina's innate knack for leadership is as sharp as that of any queen, and she found her calling in the navy, where she proved to be a very capable admiral. Ditrysium's submission to Queen Chrysalis and the subsequent mutiny of the Ditrysium sailours brought a halt to Recina's rise to fame, as the Vesalipolis Queen saw Recina as a threat, even though she had nothing to do with the mutiny. Recina's forced retirement was both unceremonious and a personal slight against her. Queen Chrysalis even planned to have Recina executed were it not for Helvia's timely intervention.\n\nBringing Recina out of retirement wasn't easy, for she had strong reservations against serving under Chrysalis. However, through Helvia's convincing and respect for her sister, Recina agreed to take on the job once more, this time under the leadership from Vesalipolis.\n\nAn aviation enthusiast, Recina brings to the forefront the importance of air power in naval combat and is the foremost proponent of carrier development, arguing that a naval airforce would be able to strike farther and harder than a conventional fleet.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

changelings_paxchrysalia.1000.d:0 "It is finally over.\n\nAfter countless months of bloody struggle, Equestria has finally succumbed to our victorious armies. On every battlefield in every theatre, the pony armies have been routed, crushed, and scattered to the winds. The enemy's organized resistance has been put to an end, and its leaders - those who haven't fled into exile, at least - have formally surrendered in Canterlot. The Great War is over.\n\nBut while the changelings back home pour into the streets in celebration from Vraks to Vesalipolis, those 'lings tasked with garrisoning our new gains are far from jovial. For while Equestria's armed forces lie in ruin, the fighting spirit of the ponies now under changeling rule will be much harder to pacify. As former soldiers melt back into their hometowns with fresh scars and painful memories of the bitter fighting on the front, the civilian population is beginning to mobilize in a way it hadn't during the war. There is much work to be done if we want to guarantee our hold over Equestria will stand the test of time.\n\nQueen Chrysalis has proclaimed this new era the "Pax Chrysalia", but those words are less of a celebration and more of a threat.\n\nConquering Equestria was the easy part. Holding on to it will be a much harder task."

Presiding over a mountain of captured Equestrian flags  —  many still battle-scarred and bloodstained  —  Queen Chrysalis declared the dawn of a Golden Age for the changeling race, having cast off the shackles of foreign suppression to assume their birthright as the terrible lords of Equus.\n    Whilst the Queen's speech was met with overwhelming popular approval, the future of the Pax Chrysalia remains uncertain. The intense militarism of the hives and the robustness of the changeling military-industrial complex had propelled the Queendom to victory, but with the Equestrian menace vanquished, the transition to peacetime may be a whole new kind of struggle - one which costs us what we might not want to pay."

The victory, the Queen proclaimed, has saved the changeling race from extinction by assimilation at the hands of foreign owners who would see them reduced to undercreatures and servants. She attributed the victory to superior spirit, heaping praise upon the Changeling armed forces personnel, while shouting a scathing rebuke of "ignorant peace" that left Equestria invasion. Unexpectedly, while the speech was nationalistic, it was not as racial as the regime's normal rhetoric. Non-changeling members of the Changeling army were metioned, and complimented as invaluable allies.\n    She finished by promising that Changeling supremacy over Equus would last for "a thousand years", and would let no Changeling be without a healthy life."

changelings_paxchrysalia.801.d:0 "Major General Jachs scribbled his signature onto yet another directive that had crossed his desk and let out a sigh, which resonated off of the walls of the basement of the Canterlot Castle. For its central location and sturdy construction, the Major General and his staff had set up their temporary headquarters there, pending the production of a dedicated command center. It was also where they lived, the flurry of paperwork and decisions being so overwhelming that acquiring real lodging was comparatively low-priority, along with basic self-care.\n\nThe doors to his makeshift office opened, and a female drone with a pleasant smile entered, exposing the room to the sounds of dozens of typewriters and mechanical calculators in the halls outside. She saluted perfectly in front of him, dropped a folder down, and said, "Major-General! Direct orders from the Queen!"\n\nThe exhausted Jachs wanted to pass out, but instead, he replied, "I'm sorry, but could you read it to me?" \n\nThe drone, Lieutenant Alcippe, cleared her throat and began. "Major-General Jachs. Reinforcements have been dispatched from the bureaucracy and accounting corps, as well as logistics. The papers beneath are your new primary objective. In summation, there shall be a grand parade celebrating our victory, which you will organize. It will display our military might and domination, and will be how generations to come see this day, hence why it requires your full attention.\n\n"There is also a decision to be made. For political reasons, it is best that this parade show off such things as prized captives, large crowds, and Equestrian nobility bowing to us. However, my head of security advises me that it is unsafe to be so close to masses of ponies at this time. As it is your region, I am leaving it to you to make the choice.

changelings_paxchrysalia.2.d:0 "The Major-General struggled to stay awake as the parade entered hour five. The past two weeks had seen him working more off of love shamefully stolen from ponies pulled from the streets than off of sleep, and he had been overworked to begin with. In spite of that, a flight of jets screamed overhead on a low pass, and he could only smile. He could imagine how proud he would be watching the film being taken when he was better-rested.\n\nThe Queen sat a few seats over, and was trying very hard to maintain a royal façade, but cracks appeared from time to time, usually centered around her massive grin, which she had had since the start. Today, nothing could dampen her spirits.\n\nThis was lucky because the event wasn't perfect. When her soldiers had broken out into an inappropriate and borderline treasonous song mid-march, she took it with good humor (it was indeed very funny). When the nobility brought forth to swear oaths of fealty to their new ruler had to be made to bow with a rifle butt, she still didn't seem that torn-up. In general, the ponies dragged out to be spectators were livid, but who cares what they think? Their love fills regardless.\n\nThe fact is, this parade was another façade, erected to hide the upcoming disaster that made Jachs's head hurt to think about. Not just because it would be up to him to clean it up, but because he couldn't expect help. He was probably the only Changeling in the high stands who would still give a damn about that if they weren't being paid to.\n\nIn a few years, the memory of this event would come with a bad taste in the nation's mouth.

She had a chief of security for a reason. And besides, it was still a fantastic parade. Jets on low flyby's, thousands of soldiers marching in perfect sync, all the heaviest tanks the road could survive, the works.\n\nThat said, there probably were a few too many guards at the swearing of the nobility. Everyone knew that the words were hollow. And the vastly-reduced crowds were nothing to write home about, either. All in all, it was a net positive, but not the beginning of an era it could have been.\n\nAt the after-party, in the main ballroom of the Canterlot Castle, Jachs wound-up face to face with that chief of security, Captain Dieter, who looked profoundly unhappy as he nursed a glass of water. "Did the Queen give you a hard time about the reduced size of the parade?"" Jachs asked, hoping to break the ice.\n\n"She defeated a god once. She forgets that that doesn't make her immune to sniper fire... but then she remembers." He replied emotionlessly. Jachs was regretting talking to him. "You made the right choice. These creatures are children of the Helvetinkatse. You can't trust them."\n\n"The... what?" Jachs asked uncomfortably. That word sounded Olenian.\n\n"The Helvetinkatse, the ancestral spirit of evil. They created ponies in their own image to stand forever against the master race."\n\nJachs considered this for a second, and said, "I get it, and it's good to know, but I do need to get going," lying through his teeth on all of it."

changelings_paxchrysalia.4.t:0 "Who is Right and Who is Left"
changelings_paxchrysalia.4.d:0 "Recently, a case came to the attention of the occupational authorities. It concerned the sentence of Brigadier-General Latranjer, and his late-war escapades. This case has gained much attention in the Equestrian press for being a clear example of how changeling justice differs from pony justice. For instance, the soldiers who performed the misdeeds will be spared in most cases, since they would have been executed if they had refused to carry out orders, and at least this way they are still alive for the Queen to deal with herself. The officers have no such excuse, and nearly all of them are guaranteed a death sentence.\n\nThe question is how, or more accurately, who. Normally, officers misbehaving in the line of duty are sentenced according to military law. However, some argue that trying them under civilian court is the prudent course of action. The difference is technical, but highly symbolic. Under civilian law, he and his officers will be punished for the pain he caused to the victims, while under military law, what they did is irrelevant except that they had been ordered by Queen Chrysalis to not do it. Naturally, ponies want to hear that their lives have some sort of intrinsic value, because they're like that. It's a compromise that is within doctrine, but the issue is that, as part of the military organization, Latranjer and his officers are supposed to be exempt from civilian law. That means it would involve bending the rules to accommodate the ponies' desire, and in a way which most changelings would consider to be a bad precedent both legally and politically."

Thank you very much." The soldier saluted and walked off as Marsilio sat down at his desk for the first time and looked over the hundreds of pages of reports in front of him. Quiet, well-stocked, filled with nice furniture to sit and write on... this office, as well as the rest of the new branch of the Science Ministry, was built in an old Olenian administrative building, but besides the eerily tall antler-accommodating ceilings, he had nothing to complain about except the job itself. He pulled some jerky out of a drawer and began.\n\nHis task was to fix the supply of love, which had some very obvious issues due to being essentially strip-foraging. The truth was that the scale was only becoming apparent now, as he skimmed report after report. High efficiency was a lost cause, which was bad, but the obvious and massive mathematical errors explained with "measurement confirmed, cause unknown" were even worse. In all of his notes, it seemed that nobody knew what was going on at all, only that it was basically functional at the cost of horrid wastefulness.\n\nWell, that pathetic "best attempt" by the armies was why it had fallen entirely on his group's shoulders rather than just having them as counsel. He was the state wrangler of technocrats, so if anyone could figure out how to make the needs of the state balance with the amount that could be safely harvested, it was him. In the meantime, the army would need to slow down its institutionalized raiding to keep something especially bad from happening. It would put him on a time limit to figure it out, since the victorious soldiers wouldn't sit idle and hungry forever, but he was pretty sure he could pull it off."

Bearing in mind the values involved, we can change four of them, these ones here, but these three violate an edict from the Queen directly, and the last one is reducing the size of the army, which is a good idea for the current national goals already. I have calculated a method which I believe will satisfy all conditions and leave us with a sufficient army to handle any remaining threat." With that, Marsilio paused to invite questions.\n\nThe first came from Trimmel, who spoke for the dozen Heer and Evevehr officers besides him. It also was not a question. "That is unacceptable. The army is our strength as a nation made manifest. To reduce it is to invite disaster in a massed revolt."\n\nMarsilio, who had a similar role to the dozen-odd civil and economic leaders on his side of the table, responded. "A revolt so large we need the current army will be avoided easily if we use more sustainable harvesting practices."\n\nTrimmel shot back, "And what of our new neighbors? I am the Queen's word on the Heer, and I say it stays."\n\n"And I am the Queen's word on love harvesting, and I say it gets reduced."\n\nTrimmel and his staff looked to Dieter, sitting at the head of the table, to break the tie. Marsilio and his did the same. Dieter himself was limp in his chair, staring at nothing. When he noticed that everyone was staring, he turned around to check if someone was behind him, realized they were waiting on him to speak, and racked his brain for some aphorism related to the topic. "...You can conquer from the saddle, but not rule from it." The mood died instantly at the horribly crude remark, and nobody could figure out how it related, so it was silently resolved to take this to the Queen herself."

In under an hour of discussion between him, her, and Trimmel, she had seen fit to decide in favor of his own plan. Really, there was no reason to try and force through even more collections when the Changeling army was already the best in the world.\n\nNow, his mind turned to organizing the harvest under the "Acornage Protocol", which was the responsibility of a division under his banner. The process was fairly simple. Every month, harvesters would come by and drain some love from half of the population of whatever town they were at. Not enough to do permanent damage, but still some. Then, a month later, they would come back and get the other half. It was easy, scalable, repeatable, and about as non-intrusive as it could get. The current system was basically nothing, and the one before was massed brigandry, so even if it wasn't a great quantity of collected love, it was still a vast improvement.\n\nBest of all? Because it was so basic to grasp, and so basic to do, it wouldn't be hard at all for the ponies to adapt to it as a part of life just like the other taxes."

Due to the lack of sustainable love collection methods mixed with an edict to stop large-scale harvesting until such methods are implemented, the armed forces of the Changeling state are being forced to go with almost as little as during the later Century of Hunger.\n\nThe soldiers are finding individual solutions, which are becoming increasingly colorful as discipline in this matter slips. What started as late-night grave robbery to recycle fresh corpses has now expanded to kidnapping and eating streetwalkers and the homeless. A large, impromptu racket of bribery and threats has also cropped up to try and stop news of these behaviors leaking to the upper ranks. Naturally, the locals are furious about this behavior. To make matters worse, our own citizenry are siding with the soldiers instead of with our administration!\n\nHeads of the Vhy and Heer have defended the behavior, citing "abandonment of our most revered brethren", and laid the blame at the feet of the ministers responsible for finding a solution to the love crisis in a timely manner. Few promises were made about stopping the shameful activities in the meantime."

Most watched the changelings gathered around with anxious looks, instinctively huddling closer together as they warily eyed the changelings manning the perimeter with rifles and machine guns. A few soldiers rounded up the stragglers hiding inside of their homes, and within an hour, the entire population of the town had been brought together.\n\nMarsilio kept a keen eye trained on the faces of the ponies as the changelings split the assembled ponies into two groups. Then, leading one group forward, they began to power up the machinery gathered around them. A pink glow surrounded the ponies, causing many to flinch or cry out... but their cries faded away into confused murmuring as nothing drastic or terrible happened. In a few seconds it was all over, leaving the assembled ponies looking a little sluggish and tired, but none the worse for wear. The rest of the assembled changelings dismissed them, packing up the equipment, and politely reminding the other half of the town that they would be back in a month for their turn. As the two groups reunited in the middle of town, surprised whispers bounced back and forth between them, with many ponies watching with disbelief as the changelings readied themselves to move on. There was even a little bit of laughter as the two sides shared a few embraces.\n\nMarsilio allowed himself the tiniest hint of a smile as he climbed back into the passenger seat of the collection truck. Laughter was good. That meant it hadn't been too traumatizing for those involved. And if the ponies were able to laugh about it once it was all over, then the next collection would be even easier. Given enough time, the simple Love harvests would become just another part of life for these ponies."

The Monarchs were getting more boring by the day since the victory, and they were never an exciting bunch to begin with.\n\n"Indeed it is," Queen Argynnis of Vraks said from her Vesalipolis subthrone. "You have shown a distressing willingness to discard our culture for your own benefit, and while this has usually been incidental with the trends of the day, your appointment of Minister Jachs to the position of Minister of Central Equestria is practically an active attack against our way of life."\n\n"The position is necessary." Chrysalis retorted. "I am sure you have seen the mess it is in now. The Black Generation did more than we could have imagined, and this is part of trying to replicate their success."\n\n"The Black Generation was exiled from the nation for being foreigners in all but name! You should not be trying to imitate them!" Argynnis shouted. "And yet here you are, giving the power of your word to an officer who has consistently shown a disturbing amount of ideological initiative. By the Yellow Queen, the Thoraxians tried to recruit him!"\n\n"He refused them with such ferocity that he was stabbed for it, if you recall." Chrysalis began. "Furthermore, I do not know how you expect us to exert influence over a population many times our size who hate us. We cannot simply walk in and demand they start wearing grey coats and abandoning their gods. Many have tried, and it has never worked for long."\n\n"Does it matter?" Queen Yaria chimed in. "If your plan goes through, then the changelings still will not own the continent. The only difference is that the rulers have carapaces instead of fur. If it works."\n\n"The fed masses will get over it." Chrysalis waved. "And if you can not, then recall that I have never had a defeat I couldn't recover from. If that isn't reason to trust me, then it is reason to follow anyways.""

He had produced a series of propositions for Queen Chrysalis on ways to effectively use surplus love for things besides the military, but since she was in Canterlot yet again, it fell to the Council to deliberate. This was unfortunate, as they were less concerned with the morality of popular support programs like these, but at least there were concrete utility arguments. The value in workers who can work 14-hour days without issue was self-evident. The Queens also tended to have less respect for changelings from minor hives and for non-royals, of which Marsilio was both.\n\nHe had not remembered to bring a copy for himself, so he had nothing to do while they poured over his notes. Apparently his aides had better foresight: two were playing Changeling Chess disguised to look like a briefcase, and were both in the post-Queen phase (somehow). The rest were watching them. Marsilio would join them, but he had to be alert in case a decision was made.\n\nIt turned out to be the right train of thought because just then a well-dressed changeling who spoke for Queen Argynnis appeared from the Council's room. He floated back the pile of documents and said, "Your proposals are all accepted. Start at will."\n\nMarsilio bowed and said, "Thank you," before rallying his aides to begin.

"I have brought you here to discuss the matter of the new restrictions brought on by our love economy. I believe I have found a way to give our land forces a little more leeway. We can re-task the "Special Ambassadors" to the Heer to act as a nonintrusive force for foraging love. It could also be positive outreach. What are your thoughts?" Twenty years ago, the Special Ambasadors had been a dedicated force for diplomatic infiltration, and was a pillar of the state's strategy to build up in peace. Now that their nation was powerful enough that others had to treat it like a real entity, the SA was struggling to find a purpose.\n\nTrimmel spoke first. "My Queen, I think this is the correct course of action, but we would still need to check with VOPS first. They are currently our biggest experts on non-duress interrogation, and it could set back efforts if we lost them."\n\nChrysalis, who had already gotten Vaspier's go-ahead, responded, "It was VOPS's idea, and they already have a plan to fill the role. If we go slow, we shouldn't have too much trouble. How about you, Queen Aurantia?"\n\nAurantia had been the original creator of the group, and her hive was its primary recruiting ground. Aurantia thought for a second, and answered, "It feels weird to see an organization you created turn into something completely different but still used. Either way, it's not really in my court anymore, is it? If you need my decision, then sure."\n\nQueen Chrysalis gave one last look around, and seeing that neither had any further concerns, said, "Then it is decided!

The angular white symbol of the Vhy flew besides the normal Changeling banners, as they were in charge of running the program. Below him, thousands of POW's stood around, being ushered into a long building one at a time. Because of the size of it, they couldn't tell that they weren't coming out the other side. In each of the chambers of the building, soldiers were taking pre-made cocoons out of crates, placing the prisoners into them, and then shipping the cocoon-filled crates by truck to Vevilsberg. There, they would spend the next few years being fed their happiest memories on repeat as their body slowly wasted away into a wrinkled husk not even worth eating. It made Marsilio feel sick.\n\nUndercaptain Carnara sat next to him, much less perturbed by the whole ordeal. "So far, it's going well. This should let us delay the Acornage plan rollout until it's perfect and still have a massive reserve of love." He looked at Marsilio, sympathetically. Although he was good at his job as Minister, Marsilio was understood to have a mental illness that made it hard to separate the under-races from himself. He worked hard enough that nobody who mattered thought less of him for it. "I understand that that might not make you feel better, but I'm not sure what you were expecting."\n\nMarsilio didn't know what to say. "I just...

The spreadsheet was part of Finicus's job, and it was judging the probable economic value of every zone and how it was so. This was important because Changeling companies would want to try and buy stakes in regions for extraction, processing, etc.\n\nThe crucial equation was that virtually every large Changeling company was not only state-owned, but owned directly by the hive's Queen as an extra revenue stream for the treasury (which was also owned directly by the local Queen). Queens weren't fans of selling their companies to other hives for that reason, on top of old autarkic habit. Therefore, the only way for one to go out of business was for an entire hive to become insolvent, which wasn't going to happen in the foreseeable future to a hive that could afford these regional stakes. It would not be economically healthy for these new regions to have their local companies replaced by pre-existing ones that were going to be there forever no matter how efficient they weren't, but it could be strategically healthy for the broader Queendom to have first- or second-pick of the outputs via their own companies.\n\nThus, it made sense to let it happen... sometimes.

The newly instituted Case Overcast seeks to make the most out of the fallen remains of Equestria, gathering up pony scientists from the ruins of their old nation and firmly encouraging them to share their research and discoveries with the Hegemony. To oversee the enforcement of the plan, a committee of top changeling scientists, army officers, and industrial leaders has been organized in Vesalipolis to determine where these efforts should be directed first. Named the Hegemony Science and Industry Research Compact, or HSIRC for short, the newly established board of directors has gathered to determine what should take priority in the salvage and recovery operations before the Equestrian scientists go into hiding and their research is lost.\n\nThe board, however, is heavily divided. Representatives from the Queen's Guards and the Vhy have insisted that the HSIRC prioritize military hardware and the recovery of advanced weaponry such as railway artillery and complicated electronics, while the high-ranking officers of the Heer have pushed back that the HSIRC should invest in rocketry and atomic science, as these frontiers will be the future of the battlefield. Still more demands have arisen from the sizeable faction of changeling industrialists and undercapitalists, who sense great opportunities for the Hegemony (and their own businesses) in learning from the ponies and having them teach us their technology instead of scavenging for it like vultures.

They argue that as the horrors of war slowly fade from the public consciousness, these new weapons are essential to remind the ponies that we are their masters and could now destroy them in worse ways than in the Great War to prevent them from rising up. To this end, they have forced plans through the rest of the HSIRC despite the rest of the council's protests, to acquire as many Equestrian scientists, engineers, and technicians to create a massive railway cannon, the likes of which has never been seen before.\n\nTermed the Soryth-Drer Rilwirkanen, the artillery piece, which will have an effective firing range of over 40km while delivering a shell carrying 700kg of high explosives, will weigh roughly 1,350 tonnes, be 47 meters in length, and require two parallel railway tracks for transportation.

After spending long hours arguing with the HSIRC, the Heer had finally gotten its way, and pony scientists and engineers had been diverted to the rocketry programs that led by some of Marsilio's closest colleagues. The rocket, a metal tube standing fifteen meters tall with a cone on one end and four rudders on the other, glistened in the midday light. Though he was the Minster of Science, and was hence responsible for overseeing the centralised scientific efforts of the Hives, Marsilio's expertise was in the realm of biochemistry and medicine, and thus some of the finer details of the launch were lost on him. His colleagues did their best to explain how the liquid propellant system worked, and how the powerful engines allowed the rocket to achieve a range further than any artillery system currently in existence.\n\nThen the countdown began, and all eyes turned toward the rocket. Its base began to smoke, the cloud carried away by a slight breeze, and then a guttural roar burst out over the field. For a moment, Marsilio lost sight of the rocket in the cloud of debris, but then he saw its metal cone breach the top of the smoke cloud. It burst forward into the sky, a tail of blindingly white fire pushing it onwards, and soon it rose higher and higher and higher, climbing faster than any plane in the Evevehr's arsenal. He watched it disappear into the clear blue skies overhead, where eventually the nose pitched over and it began to descend toward the ocean to the west.\n\nAs the scientists and engineers around him cheered for a successful test, Marsilio's eyes lingered on the sky far above them. Changeling rocketry had come so far ever since getting the HSIRC's approval to fund these projects. One day, the rockets would be able to strike the Riverlands from the outskirts of Vesalipolis. But what if they could go further? What if, one day, those rockets could carry changelings up high above the sky, out to the moon... or even beyond?\n\nIt was little more than a pipe dream for now, but it gave Marsilio some hope that the advances the Heer made to wage war across the world could someday be used for peaceful purposes beyond this world."

"Why did you choose to be a surgeon, anyways? You get more attached to your subjects than I do, and I picked this job specifically because I can sit a thousand kilometers away from the nasty part." Vivorner asked, only half-expecting an answer.\n\n"I used to help creatures, that's why! I didn't realize I would end up butchering living, thinking creatures for it!" Marsilio groaned painfully. "It's all I can do to use every anesthetic known to science, and they still scream! And what of my colleagues? They don't even give that courtesy, hell, some of them like to hear the begging! Is it any wonder the entire world wants us dead?"\n\nVivorner sighed. He had spent his lunch break on this. "Well, if you want to help creatures, you're still a doctor, and you're a minister of science. I'm sure you can throw your rank around a bit and do some good."\n\n"Oh, that's easy for you to say! You can run an experiment without having to super-classify it for fear the ponies will find out what you did and kill you. Maybe it's my lot to be a force for misery..." Marsilio was falling apart.\n\nVivorner rushed to put a stop to it. "Well, look at the Equestrian health system. It was different from ours, right? What can we steal from theirs to be better?"\n\nMarsilio's sobbing slowed as he processed the question. Then it subsided entirely as he kept going. Can't keep a good thinker down, Vivorner thought, as Marsilio asked, "Well, there is one thing. But I can't do that, it's totally out of my division and it would intrude on the monarchists terribly. It wouldn't pass."\n\nVivorner looked at him. "Either try it or don't, friend.""

"So what are you going to offer me?"

And that the other major nations of the world hate us for many reasons. We need to start creating allies for the future."\n\nChrysalis rolled her eyes. "And I suppose this is where you humbly ask some extremely expensive charity project which we will see no tangible returns on."\n\n"Y-yes." Marsilio stuttered. Chrysalis twirled her hoof, as if to tell him to get on with it. "The... The Equestrian healthcare system was world-class, but inefficient. Regionalism and privatization meant that companies would hoard proprietary medicines in order to control production for when they sell them to the distributors. Now we own nearly all of them." He prepared to take the final leap. "If we collected and translated all of the medical texts, we could create a compendium that would advance the standard of medicine by decades in poorer regions." He felt awkward, as if he had more to say, but it he couldn't think of anything else that wasn't obvious.\n\n"And the next generation's first exposure to us isn't with complaints about how we run our nation, but with a reminder that we helped exterminate Cholericism in their homeland." Chrysalis rubbed her eyes. "I can taste that you are aware that same monopolization brings profit to our hive-owned health complex, and that this compendium would destroy it for us. Surely you have more to offer?" Marsilio stood still nervously. As much as Chrysalis knew what the Severyanan Protectorate was doing to their reputation no matter how much she distanced everything from them, she had hoped for more reasoning."

He'd been recalled to Vesalipolis to handle some administrative things, and had been requested to settle an issue here on the return trip. "It's built off of all work and no play, sadly," Jachs said, "and more sleepless nights than you'd hope. Even still, the resistance means it's all hardly smooth."\n\n"Funny you should mention that..." The Governor gestured to some anti-changeling graffiti on a nearby building and frowned. "We're having a problem with the resistance spreading propaganda here. It seems like they've mobilized the entire youth population of the city to spread their messages past curfew, and we just can't stop them all. We did manage to arrest some foals that were creating some of it, colts and fillies around thirteen or fourteen years old, and we're having trouble deciding what to do with them. VOPS thinks they're in contact with a resistance handler who's giving them targets and messages."\n\n"And where do I come in?" Jachs said, raising an eyebrow.\n\n"Well, how should we punish them?" The governor stopped and rubbed one forehoof against the opposite foreleg. "Well, the obvious answer is hard labor, public beatings, death, so on. But they're kids, and I know ponies take that seriously. But I also can't just let them go with a few days in the can so that they can get back to it as soon as they get out.

changelings_paxchrysalia.31.d:0 ""...And when you're done, I'm here representing the Queen to answer your questions." Jachs sat back down and looked around the table at the dozens of ponies and changelings scanning the paper in front of them. It would likely take them a while to comprehend it. It was the Queen's most recent edict, and it was such an event that he had gathered as many governors as he could to go over it face-to-face.\n\nIn those few pages was the future plan for peacefully integrating the foreign territories into the Changeling way. It described a sliding scale of engagement with the central authority, with the minimum being paying taxes and hosting a garrison but being otherwise left untouched. It was shockingly tolerant, and it was economically discouraged. To work with the state, it was required to buy more and more into the Changeling way of life, building in the style and dressing in the clothes, and since the state directly owned much of the economy, that was almost necessary to truly get ahead. The edict also allowed anyone to purchase the contracts of temporary "servants" as under the same rules as a Changeling, although the "servants" were nearly all sold by the Changeling state, and ponies had little interest in owning slaves.\n\nThe first raised hoof was from a nervous, scrawny pony in the back. He began, "Looking at the part about indentured servants... Does this mean that we can buy them just to set them free early?"\n\nThat... was a good question, and not decided. On one side, it would follow the spirit of the law, and would increase income as ponies bought each other just to free them, increasing the demand and allowing the free-ponies to start paying taxes sooner. On the other, restoration of slavery had been a major promise for the monarchists, and they wouldn't be happy if supply died because of this. Nor would the soldiers who had died to restore an ancient Changeling tradition, and Jachs didn't dare disrespect dead veterans."

In this major chamber, lumpy stone spikes and glassy crystals cut a maze into the floor, and Finicus was sitting in the center on a wooden chair.\n\n"It's a nice place. Quiet. You say my office is fine. I say the wealth of two empires cries out to be spent. So I take time to walk down do my thinking here." Jachs navigated around and sat on a chair besides him. Finicus took one last moment to enjoy the silence before continuing. "I have been working on something related to slaves with Minister Marsilio. Ponies die if they don't eat, don't drink, don't rest. Many ponies are the Queen's property. She wants to get value out of them with minimal cost, but doesn't want to pay to replace them or deal with negative press. We have been finding a balance."\n\nJachs nodded. "Makes sense so far. Where do I come in?"\n\n"We had an idea, but it introduced many variables we had no information about. So I called you here. As we will have tens of thousands in direct government employ for years or decades, it would be easy to take the opportunity to indoctrinate them how we wish. We do not know if that is a good idea in the long run. It would produce more resilient slaves who are more amenable after they are released, but ponies would likely find it distasteful, and it is not clear to us exactly how "easy" it would be. Should we go through with it?"\n\nJachs thought for a second. "Firstly, they're "indentured servants", because slavery is another thing ponies hate. Secondly...""

Their uniforms were kept perfectly, even if the modernity left something to be desired. Flawless training was a necessity in an army made of criminals and slaves. There was a nervous stillness in the air, as if the city itself knew that things were changing, and not necessarily for the better.\n\nLieutenant Alcippe straightened Jachs' hat with a glow of green magic and grinned at him. "About time you get a parade for your work," she said. "The Queen will be pleased to see what progress you've made in promoting compliance here in Canterlot."\n\n"Not just me, Lieutenant," Jachs said. He didn't mean that as a compliment, but Alcippe took it as one and averted her eyes as if to try and dodge it. "I'm taking some time off tomorrow, Alcippe. Feel free to do the same."\n\nThere wasn't much more to be said after that, as the tolling of the noon bells in Canterlot meant it was time to set out. Jachs shared one last look with Alcippe before blowing into a whistle and setting the parade of disciplinary troops moving, and he made his way to his staff car as the officers and NCOs — each made partially of ponies and changelings — took command of the parade from there. It was going to be a long day of marching and ceremony, but for the first time in quite a while, the Major-General had created it for himself. Hopefully the Queen would be pleased with the results.

Minister of Central Equestria Jachs himself had just finished his reasoning for creating the units, an explanation peppered with profound national duty and blunt moral distaste in equal measure.\n\nCaptain Dieter started the responses. "If we must have mixed-race and penal units, combining the two as a frontline group is as good as it can get. My own investigations say that these are above-board, so I have to support them."\n\nHives' Marshall Trimmel spoke next. "I wholeheartedly support them. Truly disposable troops would be a great tool in our arsenal, and their diversity will make them better for international operations."\n\nQueen Argynnis followed. "As do I. On top of that, it is a triumph of civilization and our rulership against the riotous hordes."\n\nChrysalis responded, "I am surprised that you are not concerned by these units being pony-majority, Queen Argynnis."\n\nArgynnis shot back, "I am not half as concerned about our slaves slaving as you are that the first ponies to fight for you in large numbers did so with whips to their back. Or is this meeting not about your ego when everyone else agrees that this force is good?" Dieter shot her a deathly glare that made her stop, but the point was made.\n\nChrysalis looked pleadingly at Minister of Economics Finicus, who said, "They can recoup costs. Do international jobs.

I have something I need to discuss with you." Said the phone defeatedly.\n\nJachs picked up a deck of playing cards to fidget with. "Oh, is this about me throwing your letters in the trash? That's a serious government channel, and I already told you that a racial caste system is directly against the charter."\n\nThere was a pause on the end of the line, followed by a heavy sigh. "No, it's about something else. The Queen told me to start making preparations for a new unit of guards made of Thestrals."\n\n"Dieter, I appreciate the effort, but your sense of humor needs more time in the forge." Then Jachs remembered how upset she was that the first multiethnic unit was utterly unrespectable, and the Thestral census he had recently received orders for... "You aren't joking, are you? Throw me in the ocean, Dieter, we have to stop her!"\n\n"We can't! Her heart's too dead-set on letting these animals into our army! That's why I'm calling you, so that you can prepare to not do it anyways."\n\nJach's mind started racing. "How much time do we have?"\n\n"I don't know, it's until she finds the time to write the order properly. Two days? Three?"\n\n"Alright, thanks for the heads-up. I'll see what I can do." This was so bad. It wasn't that the bats were bad creatures, although they did strain even Jach's tolerance. The problem was that they insisted on following their night goddess until the end of time.

His dream about hand grenades had been interrupted right before it got into the effects on people he DIDN'T like, and it was by the Thestral Guard.\n\nUndercaptain Carnara appeared in the door with a host of Queen's Guard in tow, and more running behind him to the Queen's quarters. "Captain Dieter, it's the bats" We have them in the entrances, but the Panzermotorized are still five minutes out and there's a breach in West Gate 3!"\n\nDieter threw on a coat and grabbed his sidearm from his nightstand.

Around twenty changelings in lacquered blue armor, with Breakers and a crew-served lightning gun, formed up out of the mass of rushing soldiers. Dieter took to the halls and started to march to where the fighting was about to get thickest, popping a few crystalline tablets as he walked.\n\nDue to the cramped layout of the hive, it took under a minute to get there. Not even enough time for the amphetamines to kick in. Dieter levelled his gun at the front door and watched it as the rest of the force took up positions behind desks, pillars, or chairs. The low hum of the lightning cannon being armed almost drowned out the faint screeching and scrabbling of untold numbers of bats armed with the same armor and weapons courtesy of Queen Chrysalis herself."

He had added six to his personal kill tally.\n\nQueen Chrysalis appeared from his peripheral vision. The medic said something he couldn't make out except for "unresponsive", and the Queen yelled, "CAPTAIN DIETER, STATUS REPORT!"\n\nDieter forced out some words which sounded like, "All threats eliminated, my Queen, survivors are being dealt with outside."\n\nChrysalis looked worried. "Dealth with?"\n\n"Of course. Shot, bayonetted, strangled, I don't know, all I said was to keep the skulls intact in case you want to do something with them." Dieter was in too much pain to realize that, in a few days, this whole ordeal would be censored and buried, and all traces removed. No victory parade. "Just give me a couple hours to rest, and I'll be good again. I'll be able to get back to protecting you from... from your own guards." Dieter was in no state to notice that he had just delivered a massive insult. Chrysalis, standing in a chamber echoing with doctors and pained groans caused by not listening to him earlier, was in no state to take it too seriously.

Although they haven't been explicit about this, it's not hard to guess due to the side-effects being fairly obvious, alongside the odd direct mention. The intended effect has arisen almost immediately: all throughout Equestria, ponies no longer trust their neighbors or POWs returning home from war out of the well-grounded fear that they could be changeling infiltrators. Resistance groups are struggling to find traction as the knowledge that anypony could be a changeling in disguise makes them more cautious than ever. Pony unity against the Hives is fragmented, making it increasingly difficult for Equestrians to come together and resist our rule. With outsiders becoming ostracized within local communities at an ever-increasing rate, informal communication across Equestria is beginning to slow down — and not so for our controlled communication. All of this is making the nation easier to police and rule.\n\nWhat's more impressive is that this was all achieved with just a few words and not much real action. While the VOPS is indeed increasing recruitment and operations, it has nowhere near the necessary numbers to put deep cover agents in every community throughout Equestria, but intercepted orders to nobody, post-hoc attributions, rumors spread by word of mouth, and the instinctual fear that anypony might be a changeling is proving to be just as effective, if not more so, than actually monitoring the entire nation with thousands of infiltrators.

Her insistence on using this city and this throne whenever possible was a fascination with Equestria that even Jachs found disconcerting. It was less funny still to the other monarchs. He reached the foot of her golden throne and bowed. "I am here as requested, Queen. What do you wish?"\n\n"Stand, Governor.

It was also a big risk for me, because your sympathies could have led you to act in their favor over Changelings. You have been doing just that! You have been consistent in holding back on them when they need to be punished and trusting them when they should be kept distant!

The resistance fought back with surprising ferocity with all the traps and stolen weapons it could get, but such urban combat is something our soldiers had personal experience with from 1007. The resistance cell in Whinnyapolis has been annihilated, its survivors scattered to the winds, and our grip on the city is more secure than ever.\n\nHowever, the main objective of the operation, the capture of the resistance leader Trixie Lulamoon, ended in failure. The mare was able to evade our forces after a brief skirmish with panzer-soldiers at the main resistance hideout, inflicting numerous casualties in her escape. Though we have searched high and low for her, she is simply nowhere to be found, and has likely escaped the city by this point.

They appear to have been loosely coordinated, and VOPS intelligence suggests that they were most likely retaliation to the bloody pacification of Whinnyapolis a month prior. Rebel leader Trixie Lulamoon, thought to have gone to ground in the wake of changeling counterinsurgency operations, has seemingly resurfaced to coordinate the shock offensive; graffiti bearing the likeliness of her cutie mark has been found scrawled on nearby walls in the aftermath of Harmonic Resistance attacks, as are the slogans "Great and Powerful" and "Equestria Fights On". Although most serious threats were stopped by panzer-soldier guards leftover from the fighting, their collateral damage has caused a new wave of recruitment."

changelings_paxchrysalia.45.d:0 ""I don't know how you did it, but you did it," Lieutenant Alcippe said, standing close by Jachs side as the two reviewed the communiques coming in from the VOPS infiltrators in Whinnyapolis. The operatives there had secured the latest drop-off of supplies and materiel, and were working closely to seed more infiltrators into the main resistance cell.\n\n"I don't know, myself," Jachs admitted, flitting his wings. "Captain Dieter isn't usually so... flexible, but he's working overtime on this one."\n\n"Everyone has a good side." Alcippe narrowed her eyes as she read over the notes and reports the VOPS operatives had sent them. "So, what now? We have more infiltrators on standby, ready to carry out our orders. Should we send them after Trixie directly, or take a more careful approach?"\n\n"We would benefit from getting more infiltrators into the cell," Jachs began, "but we'll hit a critical number sooner or later where we can't hide the fact they're compromised. We could instead try to get infiltrators closer to Trixie herself. That will give us better information on the resistance's plans and allow us to keep tabs on her directly. It will be more difficult, but it could pay off, especially if we figure out a way to remove her specifically.""

Among them were Major-General Jachs, his Lieutenant Alcippe, and Captain Dieter, alongside three other high officers who had played a role in the recent battle. Jachs opened the file he had been given summarizing events. "Large-scale resistance casualties, some casualties for Heer, VOPS, and Vhy forces, low amounts of bystander casualties and collateral damage. Objective Curtain... that's Trixie... reported escaped with severe injuries, fate unclear. City deemed 'stable.'" The officers all looked contemplative, except for Dieter, who looked lost in his own mind. "It's a shame she got away, but I think we can call it a success overall."\n\nThe Lieutenant-Kurnal, who's headquarters they were in, said "It's no contest when we're the only ones with infiltrators, honestly."\n\nThere was a scream and a crash, and they all turned to look at a hired help pony standing in the door with a combat knife embedded in her eye and a tray of broken porcelain on the ground. Dieter was the culprit, and he went up to her, pulled his knife out, and jammed it into her throat, over and over, until she fell over dead. The Lieutenant-Governor jumped up and shouted, "WHAT IN THE QUEEN'S NAME ARE YOU DOING!?" as the entire room sat baffled and appalled at the outburst, trying to make sense of it.\n\nDieter didn't defend himself or even try and wipe off the blood he was covered with, he merely picked up something on the ground. It was an Equestrian gun, dripping with coffee and gore. "Colt 980, E-R-A-G-I. It seems we are not the only ones with infiltrators," he said annoyedly.\n\nAs the room erupted into chaos, Jachs could only sit perfectly straight as if it would fix that he had just nearly died."

changelings_paxchrysalia.47.d:0 ""Your Majesty, I've received urgent news that requires your attention."\n\nQueen Chrysalis lazily raised an eyebrow as Major-General Jachs approached her seat on the balcony overlooking Canterlot. "What is it, Minister?" she asked, not even bothering to take her eyes off the sunset.\n\n"It's an urgent transmission from our operatives in Bales," Jachs answered her, unaware of her inward thoughts. "A key resistance figure, codenamed Lodestar, will be personally present in the city to oversee a major operation. The pony's real name is Starlight Glimmer."\n\nChrysalis' eyes widened, and she turned to Jachs with rapt attention. "Starlight Glimmer will be in Bales?" she asked, a menacing grin forming on her muzzle. "Yes, I did order you to mention that. Get my guards, I'm going to go hunting!"\n\nJachs took a step back and shared a concerned look with Queen's Guard Captain Dieter, who was also nearby. "My Queen," Dieter cautioned, "This is an abortion of safety and I cannot possibly allow-"\n\n"On the contrary!" Chrysalis proclaimed, standing up. "Starlight Glimmer is Twilight Sparkle's protégé, and one of the most adept mages in the world. My presence is necessary! Show me who else can defeat her!"\n\nDieter looked at Jachs with hollow resignation that was supposed to look like pleading, but she was right. Removing Starlight Glimmer was a question with no good answer, and although this was a disaster waiting to happen, it was the first way anyone had figured out to kill the archmage. Chrysalis had beaten Celestia herself before, and that was an even tougher opponent..."

Her fighters, gruff and intimidating, had it surrounded, and were standing around to make sure it didn't accidentally go forwards into the tunnel just ahead of it. "...So don't worry, we're getting Equestria back, one adventure at a time! Feel free to swing by and join us!" One of her own walked over, a nerdy little changeling in a suit in tow. "And here's the governor! Everypony stomp your hooves for the guy who's organizing security here!" She couldn't believe she had to be here herself. This was too easy.\n\nThere was a loud bang, and something flew through the air from the other side of the train, panicking the passengers and rousing her goons to attention. It was long, weighted... a rifle grenade? Why would a guard have a rifle grenade? She threw up a magical shield and it exploded harmlessly as automatic changeling weapons rattled off.\n\nWhen she looked around, the soldiers nearest here were falling to the ground, their heads twisted at unnatural angles. In her peripheral vision, she saw that the governor had grown to be twice her own height. She leaped forwards to dodge the magical grasp and turned to discover that Queen Chrysalis was there in the black, malevolent flesh.\n\n"What were you saying about our security?"" The long-legged monster bellowed before releasing a powerful blast of green magic that tore at Starlight's flesh as it was deflected at the last second by a magenta wall. The civilians were in a mad stampede, her troops were dropping like flies from fire behind the fleeing masses, and she was facing down the toughest abomination that the Changeling Lands could vomit up."

changelings_paxchrysalia.848.d:0 "She was running up the train, dodging or deflecting Chrysalis's attacks. It was clear that the bug had her outmatched. Shots were flying past her or hitting her shield faster than she thought possible. "Now you're in my way personally!" She shouted behind herself, hoping to distract the thing.\n\n"Thank you!" Chrysalis shouted back, unleashing a larger bolt that flew right past Starlight's head and threw a resistance member in front of her directly into the wall of the nearest train car.\n\nStarlight ran through the cloud of dirt kicked up by the blast and crossed through the coupling to the other side of the train. Running wasn't a plan... but it was! The tunnel was just a short distance ahead and was already wired to explode! She sprinted forwards with all her strength as Chrysalis clambered over the car onto her side. "I didn't mean that as a compliment!"\n\n"But I did!" She heard as she ran into the blackness of the tunnel. A ways in, she turned around on the spot and ran directly at the queen. Chrysalis saw the challenge and tried to send the most powerful blast she could, but Starlight didn't block it. Instead, she summoned every last drop of mana and teleported as far as she could, well out of the tunnel, and kept running, stepping on plunger of the nearby detonator as she ran. The sound of the blast was deafening, her bones shook and she choked on dirt.\n\nOnce she was out of the dust cloud and then a bit further away, she turned around and looked at the damage. A wall of rocks sat in the mouth of the tunnel, no queen in sight, and not much gunfire either. As a few of her allies ran up to make sure she was alright, she jumped for joy. She had killed the queen herself! A burst of rifle rounds cracked nearby, and she and her entourage cut celebrations short to retreat. The enemy retinue was still out in force. As she tried to create a shield to block the bullets, she realized that she couldn't feel her horn."

changelings_paxchrysalia.948.d:0 "Dozens of changelings and a few hired ponies were hard at work, clearing the tunnel as fast as possible. Captain Dieter stood nearby, taking witness reports and overseeing the excavation. Some of the digging was done with large construction machines, some with magic, some with bare hooves, as they tried to find their Queen. Her reckless assault had pulled her away from her guards before she got buried, so they only had a vague idea where she was. This was a mess with the power to bring down the entire nation if she was dead, and the fact that the rest of the fight had gone well wouldn't outweigh even a minor injury for such an important figure.\n\nOne of the workers called out, and the rest ran to him, shoveling and grabbing debris as fast as possible. Within a few minutes, a certain tall black Changeling Queen shakily stood from the pile of rubble. Greenish ichor dripped from small cracks in her horn. Dieter said nothing. He just stared with the annoyance of a thousand sunny glares.\n\nThe Queen walked up to him weakly, and tried to speak, but fell over from exhaustion. Medics rushed to her side to carry her away to where she could rest, and Dieter just stood there. In his mind, he wondered. His ideas on the military were exhausted. His ideas on politics were now considered an embarrassment to the nation. If she was going to obsolete his role as head of security by putting herself in stupid dangers, why was she keeping him around at all?"

changelings_paxchrysalia.49.t:0 "The Resistance Collapses"
changelings_paxchrysalia.49.d:0 "After considerable time and effort spent to carefully seed infiltrators throughout the Harmonic Resistance, the Heer and the Vhy worked in unison with the VOPS today to deliver a series of crushing blows to partisan forces throughout the Equestrian heartland and north-west. Information on partisan plans was passed along to the military, which coordinated assaults with VOPS infiltrators to rout and decimate resistance cells as they moved on their objectives. Targeted partisan cells found their safehouses stormed and raided, while ponies on sabotage and terror operations were met with prepared defenses and ambushes that cut through their ranks like a hot knife through butter. Within hours, much of the regional resistance network was in chaos and ruins, with isolated and confused partisan groups as of yet still fighting for their lives but dwindling in number as our forces close in on them.\n\nHowever, despite all our successes, the leaders of the Harmonic Resistance, two mares by the name of Trixie Lulamoon and Starlight Glimmer, have managed to escape the carnage. Their whereabouts are currently unknown, but it is thought that they were heading east to escape the reach of VOPS and Vesalipolis. Yet for all their effort, it matters little how far they run, for the Harmonic Resistance is in shambles and is unlikely to recover soon from this grievous blow. Today is a day to celebrate a job well done and applaud the excellent coordination between branches that made it possible."

changelings_paxchrysalia.50.d:0 "The Heer has been working in close coordination with VOPS in order to perform another large-scale anti-resistance sweep around Whinnyapolis, but it has run into issues that have ground the campaign to a halt.\n\nThe first issue is that the previous campaigns targeted the leadership and left survivors, who have since figured out a number of ways to defeat infiltration attempts. Comparing notes reveals that our operatives are pooling in low-level, low-importance areas away from the main groups, or being denied entry on suspect charges. Only a few operatives seem to have dodged the new security measures, and they are also having trouble making it up the ranks.\n\nThe second issue is that the resistance movements have started to infiltrate our organizations in larger numbers. This is being caught and handled often on our side, as well, but strange coincidences are making it clear that our security methods are not 100% effective just the same. Luckily, VOPS is a nightmare of paranoia and omnipotence, so they can be trusted to stay secure, although the Heer and other anti-resistance groups can not.\n\nThus, the current situation. Both sides are in a structural race of trying to out-infiltrate the other, where we both must dedicate substantial resources to continue the efforts at no gain simply so that our respective side is not the loser. And for the resistance, it's much cheaper to play."

changelings_paxchrysalia.51.d:0 ""What are we going to do?" Dieter sat limp in the chair opposite Jachs. They were in a meeting which was one they'd had a dozen times in the hopes of finding something new, but the problem remained the same. They had, through great cunning, gained a number of ways to try and kill Starlight Glimmer with the few agents in position, but whichever one they tried was their only guarenteed shot, and all of them were bad. She was too cautious for poison or a bomb, but anything else small enough to get next to her was small enough to not work by a large margin. Rumor abounded that Starlight had lost her magic somehow, but the VOPS thought it was a trap. "If only we had an archmage of our own, this wouldn't even be a question."\n\nJachs replied, "We'll just have to stick to the holding pattern. Keep up the policing, try and erode her support until we can get a better angle on her." Jachs didn't like it either.\n\nDieter gained some semblence of life. "I do have a suggestion about that. What if we figured out what kind of personality made a pony more rebellious? Then we could watch out for it, and catch the problem-causers before they start misbehaving."\n\nJachs turned to stare at the painting behind him. "Resistance is an economic problem. If we pre-emptively remove all the zealots without fixing the root cause, all we've done is delay. This is an expensive idea, and although you don't care, I am obligated to mention that the ponies would hate it if they found out about it."\n\nDieter sighed. "I swear, these ponies have hearts of iron but stomachs of paper. Regardless, the extra breathing room would keep things under control for longer."\n\n"I wish it were so easy", Jachs continued, "But the Queen's coffers aren't bottomless. Going after your plan means making cuts somewhere else, and on something that might not work. Should we do it? Well...""

changelings_paxchrysalia.52.d:0 "Captain Dieter and Minister Finicus walked through the windowed halls of the upper Queen's High Tower. In Dieter's magic was a folder of graphs and charts, which he was flipping through. "I must say," he began, "I was surprised that I could come up with something new. I should have expected you to already have it planned, plotted, and deemed infeasible."\n\n"It's my job," Finicus replied. "I have psychological profiles by the thousand. It is an obvious avenue. Have you seen the problem yet?"\n\nDieter skewed his head at one of the graphs, depicting a sort of bell coated in notes. "I have not. What stopped this from being put into practice?"\n\nFinicus began. "There are only a few personality traits that affect rebelliousness. Most are hard to spot. Narrow the field of view, and focus on the most productive rebels - the serial snipers, the organizers, the convincers - and that changes. Certain exceptional qualities become common. The issue - the most productive rebel is usually the most productive pony plus an unfortunate ideological conviction." He saw that Dieter wasn't getting it, so he brought an example. "The Vhy is new. Its officers are still drawn from the most exemplary. Those who rise to any challenge, always seem to have luck on their side, can perform minor miracles for the good of the group. The most effective rebel ponies are the same breed.\n\nIgnoring that Finicus had just called his loyal army "the same breed" as the ponies, he asked, "I get who you're talking about. What's the problem with just removing them?"\n\nFinicus glared at him. "Most exceptional ponies are currently not on our side. However, if they were all removed, neither side would have pony leaders, or masters, or heroes. We would be unable to replace them. Our occupied lands would become peaceful, but ungovernable from lack of skilled managers. As the Minister of Economics, I cannot support that.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.53.d:0 "Major-General Jachs stood in the gardens of Canterlot Castle at the pre-arranged meeting place, and watched as a certain dissheveled, pale unicorn with a grey mane approached him. "Hey there", he said, "What's with the secrecy?"\n\nThe unicorn disapeared in a burst of green fire, revealing Captain Dieter. "We think there's some assassins trying to get me, because ponies never learn. What's your issue?" Jachs gave the manilla folder to Dieter, who flipped through it and recalled what it was. It was an order for promotion of one Glossus Sicarus. "Okay, what about it is concerning?" He asked. Glossus was being promoted to Kurnal for political reasons, but was a perfectly capable officer of the Vhy. Potentially a bit too bold, but that was fine.\n\n"The amount of information." Jachs replied. "It's clear that much of it has been redacted for security reasons, and it makes me uncomfortable how much considering his alignment with the Vhy, who are not known for their restraint in matters I would have them be restrained in. Since he will be operating in my area, I have the right to get the full version."\n\nDieter cocked his head at him. "This level of security isn't abnormal. How long have you been trying to get any files at all on Lieutenant Alcippe?"\n\nJachs grimaced. "Yes, and that is annoying, but she seems fine. This still has the potential to be a big mess. Such rapid promotion means that he's probably an extraordinary figure, for better or for worse, and I need to know if any of it will make him a problem."\n\nDieter thought for a second. "Well, that's reasonable, but it's not easy for me to get that kind of thing released, either. It would be a good amount of time and a good amount of political back-and-forth on my part.

Because it is a city with an unusual amount of Solarists, who see Celestia as a deity rather than a political leader, it has always been a hotbed of resistance of the Solarist variety, making it hard to pacify.\n\nRecently, it underwent a massed uprising. Luckily, on-site security forces knew that this was a possibility and had plans and resources in place, so it wouldn't have gone far. Unluckily, a newly-promoted Vhy Kurnal named Glossus Sicarus was practicing maneuvers with his forces in the fields nearby.\n\nWhen he heard the news, he mobilized his army, decided that the entire city was a battleground and thus not under the Queen's occupation edicts, bullied the local commanders into letting him handle it, and promptly crushed the resistance, along with the rest of the town. City blocks were shelled apart by artillery and suburban areas had their doors kicked in and cleared. Entire neighborhoods had windows smashed by explosives and walls pockmarked with bullets. Much of the historic city has been reduced to ruins, and the amount of confirmed non-combatant casualties is still being tallied, but is already over a thousand.\n\nNews of the brutal suppression has caused a number of smaller revolts in nearby regions, many which are still being dealt with by local security. His fellow officers in the Heer are calling for demotion and/or expulsion, and even the Vhy has taken issue with his loose interpretation of the Queen's Word.

Even being distant from the political process, Jachs ended up obstructed when the "result" was a jumble of nonsense in two parts. That was when Jachs discovered that the pile of garbage files he recieved ages ago were keys for one-time pads, and he had to track down the cabinet he'd thrown them in.\n\nThe decoding itself was simple once he figured out the method. Convert the message-letters into numbers (1-29 for the changeling alphabet), do the same for the key-letters, subtract each set of key-message numbers, and convert the answer back to a letter for each. If the result was negative, add 29. Through that, he got instructions to decode the rest on a four-wheel Epsilon machine (!?) and a password to use for the task.\n\nAs he read through the full version, he realized that most of the new material was indeed perfectly normal and/or already obvious, and was just hidden so deep for dumb or shallow reasons.\n\nIt revealed, however, a few items of note that he did indeed need to know. Firstly is that Glossus was the officer who won the battle of Vanhoover by shooting artillery at refugees, an event which was still showing up on anti-Changeling posters to this day. That meant he was a possible target for partisans. Secondly is that he had bullied other officers into letting him take the lead on battles before. That was definitely necessary info.

It was an interesting problem that Trimmel loved, because it gave him something to do in his specialty besides plan for wars that he would be told to not start. \n\nThe issue was simple. A resistance 'formation' could appear nearly anywhere, hypothetically. Trimmel fought in lines, but now he had been tasked to organize the defense of an entire plane representing a good bit of the continent. Treating the entire map like a big front line didn't work, but if you looked at it as a series of battlefields, how did you determine where the fight was before it started? Trimmel had never dealt in planar strategy before. \n\nExcept he had. The front line wasn't a line, either. During the Great War, both sides had so many aerial units that the ground battle was just the biggest part of the fighting. The way you beat an incursion by Pegasi light infantry was by having your own fast units in the back lines to chase them away. So the front line WAS ALSO a plane. What if he just turned it on its side? Then he was on the ground, and his enemy was 'under the ground', sending their 'pegasi' up towards him to skirmish. In that scenario, his back-line reserves were... hovering in midair. \n\nHe began to draft a series of military experimental units, which called for a number of Jager brigades and as many of the long-deprecated Equestrian Air Warships as possible, with orders to strip them of their armaments to save weight for faster engines."

Preparing for the war was such an arduous endeavor that it left visible scars, with workmen being treated as inanimate parts in the machinery of industry. Victory meant an end. An end to the 80-hour work weeks, an end to the omnipresent threat of death, and above all, an end to the hunger. None knew what that would look like, only that it would be glorious.\n\nThis overwhelming joy found itself expressed in many ways. Riots broke out from celebrating hooligans and were left unchecked due to the police joining in. At the victory speech in Vesalipolis, an aged officer suffered cardiacs arrythmia from seeing what the rest of his family had died to create, and it was by sheer luck that he didn't become the final casualty. The Queens were split between elation at taking part, and disappointment that their life would be defined by servitude to Chrysalis. Prandialist groups baked Caramel Marks, cookies in the shape of the nation's currency, and celebrated the victory of the ethnic proletariat. The few remaining political dissidents breathed a sigh of relief that they would not get drafted.\n\nThe parties were endless, no military personnel could go without free drinks, and parades were formed anywhere the local garrison was more than twelve soldiers.\n\nAcross the border, the elation was less universal. Ponies stayed indoors for fear that the barely-restrained crowds outside would assault them. Rowdy MP's robbed gas stations to drink the gasoline, and artillery batteries fired at nothing for fun all night long. In Canterlot, soldiers broke into a building to steal chairs, and discovered an underground debauchers' club, vandalizing the sign on the way out. The group complained to the Governor, who figured out the whole story and drunkenly declared that the new name was law. The "Cock Towel Society" was not entertained."

Attached is a complete list of the resources which shall be made available to this project (Project Living Space) from the Queen's accounts in order to facilitate this. Two cities have been chosen by Her Majesty as clear options, Vanhoover and Acornage.\n\n     Vanhoover is a true major city of Equestria. To make it a second center of naval projection would prove invaluable in the creation of a truly great Changeling Zehr. To produce a second naturalized major port on the opposite end of Olenia would grant a great boon to overseas trade. It would be a symbol of our nation's control over Equestria, a beacon of our nation's strength, a jewel in our nation's crown, and a truly majestic thing to create an enduring legacy from, all while producing a zone with superior fortification against a large-scale uprising due to its size and sea access.\n\n     Acornage is none of those things. It would, however, be cheaper and safer for this project. It should be noted that the granted budget is already substantial, and delays or problems will be unaffordable.\n\n     There being no clear superior option, Her Majesty has decided to let your administration make the choice, as you are the decreed expert in these matters.\n\n     So says Her Majesty, Queen Chrysalis."

changelings_paxchrysalia.59.d:0 ""...Thus, it has been deemed the most efficient option that Acornage be the choice in Project Living Space, due to the already substantial costs of transforming land on such a scale."\n\nThe room full of bureaucrats, stooges in construction, security, procurements, logistics, and more, coming from both the changeling royal courts and the occupational governorship, nodded along, each calculating whether they believed this endeavor was within their assigned budgets and probably asking for more regardless of what they decided. Major-General Jachs nodded to Alcippe to turn off the projector, and asked, "Any questions?" Dozens of hooves, nearly all of them black, flew into the sky. "Asking any further about why Acornage was chosen will result in your organization paying the security bill," he continued, causing all but one to go down.\n\nHe pointed, and the governor of the region asked, "How much can actually go wrong? You're putting a lot of resources into this."\n\nJachs rolled his eyes. "Technically, not much, but there's still room for surprises. That's why we have some money left over for backups, improvisations, et cetera. In short, there will be some issues, but if any of them make it into the international papers, I'm coming down there myself because there shouldn't be anything which can get out of control." The room remained quiet, as each of the minsters and organizers looked over the paperwork they had been given. No one else had any questions, at least ones they would ask without several technical experts backing them up. Shortly, the meeting was adjourned."

changelings_paxchrysalia.60.d:0 ""Governor, it's Major-General Jachs. What the hell are you doing over there?" Jachs asked into the receiver. It was the middle of the night, and he was talking into the radio of a Heer soldier he had pulled aside on the road to Vanhoover. The fact that this was the third military convoy he had passed, mixed with the orange glow on the horizon, did not comfort him.\n\nThe tinny, distorted voice replied, "Major-General?! I was just looking for you! This city's on fire! Someone did something, the ponies ended up killing a changeling worker in retribution, the first wave of settlers brought out their take-homes, and now the place is in a damn civil war!"\n\nJachs groaned loudly enough to make the radioman flinch. "Drown me in the River Vraks! What's the death toll so far?"\n\n"It's already past a hundred, and the riot's still going strong. Security is half trying to stop the violence and half participating!" The governor answered fearfully.\n\nJachs decided to ask the dreaded question. "What will this do for the Living Space project?"\n\n"...It's bad."\n\n"I can see it's bad from where I'm standing. Be more specific." Jachs shouted.\n\n"A lot of construction equipment has been stolen or destroyed, a lot of buildings burned down all-around, it's a mess. We'll need better security, and more of it, because this will definitely happen again if we don't put some more measures in place. We are in deep trouble, Major-General."\n\nOver-budgets, under-performance, failure to meet deadlines, and now this, which he had to figure out on a roadside through some stranger's borrowed radio. The project was looking like a total disaster. The question was whether to press on anyways and hope to get something out of it or give up here."

changelings_paxchrysalia.62.d:0 "Major-General Jachs smiled as he watched the parade pass by out the window. It had been almost a year of hard work, but him and the extensive cabinet of specialists he had brought on had managed it. Numerous neighborhoods had been destroyed and rebuilt into monuments of concrete and rebar that touched each other above the streets and alleys. Tempted by the thought of a new hive with easy access to ponies to passively feed from and, for veterans, free space set aside just for them, changelings had flocked to it and filled out the combined megastructure, every passing day making the new hive more lived-in.\n\nAt the head of the parade was Queen Chrysalis, alongside Queen Factrix, who's family's hive had been lost to the Prandialists some decades ago. She was here to take up her newly-created throne in their newly-created hive as repayment for being a valuable ally ever since her hive was destroyed. It was deemed "only right." And truly, what changeling hive would be complete without its own royal lineage and a visit from Queen Chrysalis herself?\n\nThe transformation wasn't total. It wasn't supposed to be. Why build a hive on top of a pony city just to replace the whole thing? It would be cheaper to just build it a few miles away. No, the fact that ponies were still the majority was the defining feature of this new hive. With the population being 75% red-blood, the new settlers could gorge themselves on love and not put a dent in the local's business. Even if that was a problem, what was there to do? Most of the settlers were soldiers who, legally or not, still had many of their weapons. There would be no shortage of eyes and truncheons to make sure that everyone was behaving.\n\nThere was talk of this being the greatest of the Queen's monuments to victory, and while Jachs wasn't sure it would remain true, it would certainly be in the running for a long time."

changelings_paxchrysalia.64.d:0 "Major-General Jachs stepped into the new changeling restaurant that had opened in downtown Canterlot, the Sweet Release, and found a Heer officer in the back. It was nice to be able to get authentic food from home, but also hay fries were growing on him more than he cared to admit. As he sat down across from the dark-suited bug, he said, "So how do you like the town, Arcus?"\n\nKurnal Arcus Vren looked up from the menu. "Ah! Minister Jachs, you are here! I almost thought you were joking."\n\nJachs scanned his own menu as he replied, "Well, it's not like I need to talk to you in my office, Kurnal. Oh, and call me 'Major-General', everyone else does. I'd congratulate you on the promotion, but you can probably guess how it came about."\n\nA waiter came by, and the duo placed their orders. "Well, uh, I was wondering about that. Did you really pull some strings to get a friend in?" Arcus said.\n\nJachs prepared to say what he had come to say. "Well, there's a reason why we brought in you specifically. We needed an officer for up north. You might remember that, in exchange for their cooperation during the war, we gave Stalliongrad to the Prandialists. Well, they've been getting uppity, so we need someone to keep them from rejoining civilization, and I brought you to the Heer's attention. I even got you no force limit to make the most out of your... history."\n\nArcus smiled cruelly. Prandialists had killed much of his family. Organizing border patrol death squads against them was what the stuff of dreams for him. "I see that I chose well. This is a day to celebrate." His food, now arriving at the table, was raw pork with sugar and glowpaint and a big mug of hydrocarbon to drink, a very indulgent meal. Jachs smiled back, glad to see a friend so happy, before taking a bite of his own faux-cheval."

changelings_paxchrysalia.670.d:0 "Starlight Glimmer sat in her ersatz office as she finished her paperwork. When she had started her private rebellion, she had faintly hoped for a heroic life of adventure and fighting the good fight, but no, it was mostly paperwork, even out here in the peak guerilla territory of the Ruby Mountains. But this was how she was getting bribes for informants, pay for her professional staff, commissions for the pirate printers, and at some point down the line, guns and bombs.\n\nThe clock went off. An elderly pony was led in - elderly in the literal sense, as he was the most respected member of the village her compound was nearest to. She knew this meeting was bad news, but she tried to be cheerful. "Nice to see you again, friend! What can I do for you?"\n\nHe sat across from her, a dour look on his tired face. "I am concerned that you will have to leave. I can't justify you and your rebels staying to the other villagers for much longer."\n\n"Oh, no!" Starlight said. "Don't tell me this is about the baker who was shot in the leg three days ago. That was an accident, it won't happen again."\n\n"It's about more than that, but that's pretty bad." He explained. "We've had a lot of issues with your rebels. A lot of our roads are unusable because the armored vehicles tear them up. Oftentimes we can't go to the market without being harassed by the changelings. Random house searches are becoming more common, and our own citizens are being arrested, mostly teenagers who are having their life thrown away by this. Gunfights in the public square are just the most recent problem."\n\nStarlight was taken aback. "But most of those aren't us! It's the changelings who are doing all that to your town."\n\nThe elder sighed. "The others don't see it that way. None of that happened before you showed up..."  His face contorted with pain. "I'm sorry, but we took a vote last night. You have until the end of the month to leave. Then we tell the changelings you're here.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.671.d:0 "The fighter looked out the basement window at the crowds. It was sickening. They were celebrating the anniversary of the town's founding, an event which had once been inextricably linked with their Equestrian roots. It was like many Equestrian holidays, filled with games and relaxing and good food. He himself had led the charge to keep it an Equestrian holiday a few short years ago. Now the white, blue, and pink streamers had lost the pink so that they were as the town's flag, and the holiday was legally recognized by the foreign occupiers.\n\nHe turned away. "We won't be bothered." To the changelings sitting at the other end, he asked, "So what is it that you have for us?"\n\nThe leader was a female, dressed in a perverse imitation of a Stalliongradian political officer's uniform. Neither him nor his friends was sure how they had gotten into the safehouse, just that they were exactly on time when they appeared. She opened the briefcase she had laying on a box in the middle of the room to reveal that it was filled with potato-masher grenades, at least a dozen of them. "Free of charge," She said.\n\nThe fighter's friend looked intently. His other friend's jaw dropped. The fighter himself remained resolute. "Nothing is free. What's your game?"\n\nThe changeling laughed. "When we ask the Severyans for something, they just say 'Pozhaluysta, ne ubivay menya!' and give it. We don't question why. You wanted weapons, you have weapons."\n\n"That's because the Severyans are terrified of you." The fighter retorted.\n\nThe changeling smirked. "Maybe you'd learn how to take a gift if you were afraid of your new owners, too? Those ponies out there aren't. There's your hint."\n\nSo she was hoping that funneling weapons to Equestrian rebels would make the changelings oppress them harder. Of course that would be the Prandialist plan. "Alright, we'll take it," the fighter said forcefully, knowing that that it was only a few more attacks before the changelings left entirely."

He had another day of work ahead of him, another mind-numbing shift behind the register for pointless pay so that he could go home and stare at the ceiling. He had to remind himself that he was lucky to be getting paid in money, instead of room and board directly with no option to quit. This was the life of someone on the losing side of a war... but at least he couldn't say he didn't do his part to avoid this.\n\nAs he walked down the street, he noticed that a teenaged pony was following him. He stopped, and the teen walked up to him and tried to stand tall over him. He spoke like a commissar, "What happened to your eye?"\n\nThe veteran was taken aback at it. "I, uh, lost it during the war."\n\n"The war, huh? It's not heroic to have fought against the changelings." The teenager loudly said. The veteran looked around, baffled at what he was hearing. This kid wasn't even sixteen, what was he even trying to accomplish? To make matters worse, he'd drawn the attention of a changeling police officer across the street.\n\n"Now now, let's calm down here..." The veteran started, but the youth cut him off.\n\n"You soldiers are always going on about how great the war was, how important you are for protecting us! But you failed!" He got close to the veteran, too close, and developed a cruel grin. "Well how do you like it now? Our TOLERANT CHANGELING PROTECTORS are helping us all out and leaving you behind." Impulsively, the veteran shoved the youth away, but he realized his mistake too late. The officer was upon them now. The youth turned to the black-suited cop. "Hello, officer, this pony soldier was-" And he was interrupted by a meaty thwack as a baton buried itself in the teen's skull. He fell down, and the changeling brought it down a second time, and a third.\n\nThe veteran bowed down and begged, "Please stop, sir, he's just a boy, he doesn't know what he's doing!"\n\nThe officer simply said, "Don't you ponies beat your children?""

A number of ponies blocking the roads for better wages were getting pushed back thoroughly by a shield wall to put the ancients to shame, and she could see many getting pulled through the wall and being clubbed and arrested by trailing cops. One of the strikers stood on a parked car and started waving a red flag and shouting. He fell down in a hurry after a crack rang out, although she could tell by the sound it was a squirrel-gun he had just been hit with. She blew her mane out of her eyes, as due to her position in the government, she was allowed to grow it out as long as a Royal would.\n\nBehind her, she heard her door get forced open and her heart skipped a beat. Running at her was someone dressed in bright red instead of the legally-mandated greyscale, a disheveled youth - and he had a gun! The world spun as he leapt at her, and when it was still again, he was holding her in front of him with the floating pistol pointed at her head just like the floating rifle of the police changelings standing in the door, her heart beating faster than it ever had. "Back off or I'll kill her!" He shouted at the cops, pressing the barrel into her head. They didn't respond, and he stepped further out onto the balcony, before realizing that a swarm of riot police was the only thing in that direction. "I'm serious!"\n\nThe manager nearly had a heart attack when she heard a shot ring out, but it hadn't gone into her head, it was her leg that was screaming in pain. As was the youth, who keeled over and pulled her down with him as he hit the old wooden railing and kept falling. He dragged her all the way off, and her brain went blank as she was pulled into a fall, her apartment rising above her as she watched.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes again, her entire body hurt.

She also brushed her teeth, combed her hair, and generally made herself presentable to her owners. Checking that, once again, her wings had not come unbound in the night, she left the "servant's quarters" guest bedroom and prepared for a new day of work.\n\nAs with every day, the first task was breakfast, traditionally some sort of mutton that made her ill to think about, but she didn't have to eat it. The house patriarch walked by, having creaked out of bed at some point. His morning coffee was obviously already done. He was the only member of the household who could speak Equestrian, a great boon since the house matriarch had no desire to do so and ponies can't speak Changeling. Him and Cloud were distant, as you might expect from an unwilling slave and her weary master, but the two couldn't hate each other. She had lost a brother and father in the war, and he... well, her main job was caring for his only child, who was his third child when the little grub was born. They both had better things to do.\n\nCloud took a second to rest. The Book said she had to be a certain amount of tired, but the house's two adult bugs worked so little to maintain their modest lifestyle that they often helped her with cooking, cleaning, and babysitting to stave off boredom. She gave some love to make up the difference. As a result, everything was just a little tiring.\n\nThe respect the changelings had for The Book was impressive. The Queen didn't want to pay to replace her property, so every slave came with a book that their owners were obligated to follow, and in the Changeling Lands, the Queen's Word was law and morality. The Book made her life hard and pointless, but safe.\n\nStanding up to put the rest of the meat away for later, she mentally counted. Nine years, ten months, and seventeen days to go."

Standing at the foot of her throne were Captain Dieter and Hivesmarshall Trimmel, who had each produced one of the booklets. Dieter spoke first. "My Queen, we have acquired a substantial amount of footage from the battlefields of the war. We believe that now is the perfect time to capitalize on our newfound reputation, and produce a movie out of it, in order to forever cement our military might as the greatest in history."\n\nThe Queen nodded. It seemed reasonable. "I suppose these are proposals for films we will make."\n\nTrimmel was next. "Not quite. My... colleague's... was written by a Vhy propaganda writer. If we want to make our army known as the greatest in history, we need something with a bit more 'art', or 'soul', hence why I produced a script of my own." It really was his, too - Trimmel was credited as the lead writer.\n\nDieter snapped back, "Your script is psychopathic and miscegenistic, not 'artful'."\n\nTrimmel's counter was interrupted by the Queen shouting "Enough! I will decide myself!"\n\nAs she flipped through them, the two scripts were indeed quite different. Dieter and the Vhy had created the Queen's Guard out of the most capable of the nation's fanatic nationalists, and they had done the same with their script. In all aspects, it was pro-Changeling, so much so that she wondered if non-Changelings would get anything out of it. Trimmel's offer was less skillful, but much more interesting. He had, after all, gotten his start by orating his way into warlordry. It was pro-military, but didn't distinguish which military. It would be more appealing to disparate audiences, but probably resonate less with the changelings themselves."

The rarely discussed ailment is portrayed not as a sign of weakness, but as the final burden that some soldiers must bear for their country.\nAlthough it received no official screenings in their regions, the film was seen by some ponies.

The contention comes from the film's treatment of the ponies: their soldiers are just as glorious as our own, but are betrayed by their officers. The climax, where the pony sergeant executes the lieutenant for cowardice and leads a suicide charge that wipes out both groups of main characters, cements that.\n    Oddly, the same split of opinions appears wherever the movie is shown.

changelings_paxchrysalia.72.d:0 "The horse-drawn carriage rumbled to a slow stop. One off-duty Major-General named Jachs stepped off the side and paid the drawer what was owed, and once the grumpy pony was firmly in the distance, he breathed in contentedly. The open air and thick nature of Ponyville was starting to grow on him. Maybe it was because he was spending too much time around ponies nowadays, maybe it was just because it was his time off and so he was inclined to enjoy everything. Whatever the case, he hadn't travelled here to sniff the flowers. His true purpose was a big red barn up a dusty trail.\n\nEx-General Applejack lived there. It might have seemed shocking that she, of all ponies, would become a stooge of the changeling occupation, but she wasn't the element of loyalty. In truth, the reason was clear as this day once one found out that, rather than ask for a million bits or a mansion or a one-way luxury cruise to Skyfall, she covered nearly two hundred friends and relatives with pardons and immunities.\n\nAs usual, Applejack kept her nose down, maintained her farm as best she could, and ignored the rumors. Everyone had their own theory about what else was going on to make this happen. Even Jachs himself was somewhat guilty. Hence why he was here, on his three days of vacation for this year, wearing a "polo shirt" as ponies called it, to just ask her himself. Or maybe not, if that was too much effort. He was here on vacation, after all, not to engage in high-level thinkery and social maneuvering.\n\nThe leaves gently danced in the breeze, waves emerged in the long grass as it swayed back and forth, and a cloud was passing in front of the sun when Jachs arrived at the front door. He knocked firmly, yet not overly aggressively. The pony who answered it was an old green mare (Granny Smith, Jachs recalled), who called into the house, "Applejack! That bug's back!"\n\nThis was interesting, as Jachs had never been here before."

"You aren't the public representations changeling who normally comes around here, are you?" She asked, having gotten a better look at her guest. "Oh! I'm real sorry, forgive my manners. You're Minister Jachs, right?"\n\n"Minister, Major-General... I'm not on duty right now, so either or neither works, Miss Applejack." Jachs said. "Mind if I step inside?"\n\n"Oh, yes, sure!

"I'm not here on serious business."\n\n"Alright. Well, what are you here for? You didn't say much." Applejack wondered. "Something about wanting to talk?"\n\nHe sat down in a chair and stretched out. "That's about it, really. I'm taking a vacation, and you seem like an interesting figure to pass the time with." Jachs confessed. "And when you're a Minister under the Queen herself, you can waste the time of national heroes because you're bored."\n\n"Aw, shucks, mister. I ain't no 'national hero,' or some such thing. I was just a pony doing her patriotic duty." She said, looking away slightly.\n\nJachs waved his hoof cheerfully. "Well, if you insist..."\n\nApplejack mostly suppressed a laugh. "First time I've gotten THAT response!" She exclaimed, sitting across from him.\n\nA few seconds passed as both of them turned it over in their heads. Jachs broke the silence. "This is a big farm. At least, it looks big. It's just you and a few relatives keeping it all, right?"\n\n"Just about, yeah. I can show you around, I have a few things I ought to be doing around the property anyways.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.74.d:0 "Nearly an hour later, Jachs was somehow still entertained by Applejack's accented rambling about the history and methodology behind items on the farm. There was a certain elegant simplicity to everything, an expert wielding of every tool honed over generations of practice to create something nearly flawless in its efficiency. It was, in a way, like the factory-ranches the changelings had been constructing, but far less industrial, and yet far more superb.\n\nAt least, so his imagination said. These days were overcast for the farm. Jachs saw Applejack's big sister, Big Mac, and noted the heroic job the red pony was doing at hiding the limp in his left hind leg. Applejack herself was obviously chronically tired as well. Her little sister couldn't make up all the slack alone, apparently. There was talk of hired help, and a related complaint about her government relation putting many of her friends who could use that work on a blacklist for political dissidence, but she at least claimed to have found some good helpers. The farm clearly was still being fully maintained, but it wasn't as simple as it had once been to get everything done.\n\nNot long after, he found himself led deep into the orchard's denser region. He was wondering what exactly was down here, some ancient tree or hidden spot, when Applejack simply stopped and sat down against one of the trunks. He sat across from her on the path and waited. "This might be a bit out of left field, but mind if I ask why you called me a hero earlier?"\n\nJachs shrugged. "It's what you are, right? You fought for your country, you did a good job doing it, you composed yourself well. There's not much else to it."\n\n"Yeah, but you're a changeling! I'd expect you to be at least a little mad that I killed hundreds of your kind!" Applejack nearly shouted.\n\nHe simply sighed, and said, "We serve, we live, we die and times go by.

Jachs nodded in agreement, and she went over what she wanted to say again, deciding if she truly wanted it said. "I don't feel like no hero." Another pause. "Ponies say I'm a hero, changelings say I'm a hero, everyone says that what I did in the war is something most folks can only dream of doing. What the hell did I do? I saw my friends get torn into pieces, got my ears blown out, hurt my damn back hauling cannons up and down a mountain, and killed hundreds of changelings! They had families, a home they were fighting for same as us, most of them didn't even want to be there, and I killed them! Two hundred and forty two screaming, crying bugs! And we didn't even win!"\n\nShe gritted her teeth as tears welled up in her eyes. "Can't pull right, can't hear right, can't even get a good night's sleep without being reminded of someone I killed... now ponies are saying I made up the whole thing just because I'm tired of it and I ain't doing it no more! The war's over, Celestia damn it, let me be done with it!" Her breathing became erratic and spastic as she soon failed to hold back the crying. Jachs had nothing to say to it. He just sat there, waiting for her to compose herself.\n\nIt took a while. Half an hour, or more. When the exhausted mare finally spoke up again, she said, "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have dragged you into my problems."\n\nJachs waved a hoof. "It's fine. I have an electric fan in my bedroom. The noise helps me sleep better, if just a little."\n\n"...Right. I'll try that." Birds chirped. Leaves rustled in the breeze. "Think we ever fought? I mean, I wasn't really a general, but, you know."\n\n"We didn't. I checked." Jachs replied.\n\n"Oh."

At 22:37 last night, enemy forces dressed in Wonderbolt uniforms and carrying heavy weapons attacked the facility, with intent to subdue the civilians and detonate the transformer banks with surplus explosives. In the engagement that ensued, DROPSPIDER and on-site security were unable to repell the enemy until after the dam was disabled. \n\nDROPSPIDER suffered 3 killed and 4 wounded, 1 unharmed. The enemy suffered a confirmed 2 killed and 5 wounded, with up to a dozen casualties unconfirmed, out of an estimated 30+ attackers. Security forces fled the scene after DROPSIDER became too depleted, and their casualties are still being tallied. Later efforts by Team LAUGHINGDOG would yield 7 additional confirmed kills while tracking down injured enemies post-repulsion. \n\nSo far, this attack has confirmed numerous theories through examination and witness testimony. Firstly, High Value Target RAINBOW is leading the attacks. Secondly, the attackers have wartime equipment and training, and all identified bodies are war veterans, mostly from Pegasi units. \n\nAt the time of writing, the dam is still out of comission. Repairs are estimated at two weeks. LAUGHINDOG is continuing with tracking, but does not predict further success."

He said loudly to nobody in particular.\n\n"One of the advantages of working in Equestria." Major-General Jachs stated. "They like to indulge. Now, have you heard of my proposal?"\n\nSynovial adjusted himself around. "Yeah, I've heard it. It's got guts. I'm guessing you want me to lead it, seeing as how you dragged me all the way out here and are now bribing me with fine furniture?"\n\n"You're right. Although the furniture isn't a bribe. I just don't want any undercreature of mine working from a wooden stool." Jachs replied. "You think you can handle an Element of Harmony?"\n\n"Darn right I can." Synovial answered. "I can already see the siege rings forming around their hole. Set up the resources I need. I'll catch a flight down to the problem area to oversee the hunt myself."\n\nJachs stood up. "No, you'll lead it from here. We have a fully-stocked DC4 center in the West Wing for just this kind of mission, and the ponies have started to figure out aiming for high-level targets. Rainbow Dash especially loves that tactic."\n\nSynovial laughed coarsely. "I can take care of myself. I'm no post-war child who didn't see some blood growing up."\n\n"You underestimate your opponent." Jachs said. Lieutenant Alcippe entered the room, a toy dart gun in her magical grip. She passed it to Synovial, who eyed it curiously. "Alcippe is fast. Rainbow Dash is faster. If you can't beat the former, you don't stand a chance against the later. Put that gun away, then I'll see if you can out-draw my Lieutenant."\n\nSynovial smiled with determination. A funny test, but not without merit. He practiced his draws every morning, and he'd gotten use out of that time twice before. He put the single-shot pistol into his jacket, sizing up his opponent."

changelings_paxchrysalia.79.d:0 "Rainbow Dash stood beside the plywood shack in the dead of night. Marechester had been a combination siege and marshal law for days now, and at great cost, her and her resistance fighters had figured out who was orchestrating it - and from where. Synovial, the disappointing counterpart to Trimmel, was not far from the battlefield as usual, but he'd wisened up to her tricks and put up this temporary headquarters in the plains instead of simply taking a random building. That level of security through obscurity had nearly thrown her allies off, and it added new issues. They had to leap from a plane inside the exclusion zone and glide here to not get heard by any guards. Now, though, they were inside the perimeter, and could fly out in a hurry. Her three teammates stacked up behind her in the moonlight.\n\nShe walked forwards slowly through the short grass. This place would have been defensible if they saw Dash's team coming. They came to a door, and found that it was not only unlocked, but open, as it had no handle to close it, and Rainbow looked around it. The next room was empty, or so it seemed. When the moon wasn't in their eyes, changelings could see in the dark just fine. She clutched her submachine gun tightly in her wings and crept in. She could hear the crackle of something, and much discussion in changeling tongue. The first room led to a second through the right, and when she peeked through the doorway, she saw a single sleeping guard besides a portal of firelight. The command center.\n\nShe let her submachine gun fall limp as she pulled out a suppressed pistol and popped the guard in the head. It put out nearly no noise, and besides the clatter of the guard's gun falling from his lap to the ground, nothing. The folks inside were arguing loudly and couldn't have heard.\n\nShe turned the corner and first noticed Synovial before holding down the trigger on him. The second thing she noticed was that every other officer had an assault rifle trained on the door."

changelings_paxchrysalia.80.d:0 "From her position laying on the ground, Rainbow Dash could see as Synovial dropped his gun, stumbled, and fell from the rounds he had taken. What she knew in her heart turned out to be true as a burst of green fire erupted, and he turned into a different changeling. Holes in the wall above her stopped appearing briefly, which she took as her cue to spring back up and get out. Chucks of plywood were shot out and let the light through as she suddenly noticed that this structure had no supporting beams for bullets to get stuck in. It was one big trap. Bullets cracked around her as she stumbled over something, dodged a falling something, and heard another something fall behind her and start screaming in pain for a brief moment.\n\nIn only a second or two, she was back outside, her eyes hurting as bright white flares shot up from around the shack. She stumbled and realized there was something cold running down one of her legs before she lifted off into the air. More automatic gunfire sounded out through the night as bullets barely missed her, or caught her in the leg, or one of the "guards" fired a shotgun at the only thing in the sky reflecting the flare's light and a pellet hit her, or something hit her strap and her submachine gun fell into the darkness. Somehow, nothing hit her wings, and she could outfly anyone in that case, so she soon found herself out of immediate danger.\n\nHovering in the night air, she turned and looked back, seeing nothing following her. No changeling. No pony. Not even the ones who had followed her in. Damn. Just as she was about to lash out, she realized that everything hurt besides her wings, so she instead turned around and started flying back to the hideout for the second round of potentially-life-saving medical operations within recent memory."

The place where his horn had been hit with the rubber dart still hurt on a psychological level, but really he thought that he'd become lame and out of touch like so many officers he'd known if he started doing things like always sitting in nice chairs and engaging in other self-indulgences. This kept him sharp, which he needed if he couldn't be there. Jachs had been right, though, which was disappointing. "Synovial" was dead.\n\nThree elite rebel assassins were, too, and Rainbow Dash had escaped but left a trail of blood that wound up leading to three strongholds in a row. The Marechester resistance was in tatters now, and many doubted her miraculous escape, especially since the Heer now owned her heavily customized weapon and made sure everyone knew it.\n\nIt was a failure by its objectives, but it the long-term strategy goals were met. Synovial put a cheap cigarette in his mouth and lit it. As far as he was concerned, for someone beyond his prime and comfort zone, it was a good outcome."

changelings_paxchrysalia.87.d:0 "As Minister of Central Equestria, Jachs's rank within the government was high enough that his security clearance was virtually unlimited within his domain. It was, after all, HIS domain, organized to his wishes in order to rule as an arm of his own Queen. Just as Finicus's responsibilities as Minister of Economics gave him everything up to the power of summary execution in the performance of his duties, (contestable only by his peers or higher), so did Jachs'. Of course, in practice, this did not mean that nothing went on without his knowledge, just that it had to circumnavigate his entire power structure.\n\nWhich made it odd when one such endeavor wound up on his desk.\n\nA week ago, Captain Dieter had requested extra logistics for around two dozen Vhy guards to provide "security" for the Canterlot caves. Those caves had a limited amount of openings, most of which were in the lower levels of Jach's office-structure, so they didn't need more security. The better-defined reason for the request was completely absent. So it was denied. Now, Jachs was looking at the same request, with a heavy-handed appeal to his "national duty" and "the need for police repression of dissidents" which once again told him nothing useful. He was planning on denying it for a second time when he realized what was going on.\n\nThis was one of those secret projects that the Vhy was so fond of. There was something in the Canterlot caves that they're looking into, and because Dieter is who he is, he had decided to ask for more security directly and tactlessly, thus magically transporting it to Jach's desk via confused security chief.\n\nThe good news is that, whatever they were doing, it wasn't that bad. Since the caves were secure, he knew everything going in and coming out, and it was all above-board. The bad news is that, if he denied it here, it would get Chrysalis involved, and she might not be entertained by the whole scenario."

changelings_paxchrysalia.88.d:0 ""I can't believe it, but I'm starting to miss before the war. Back then I had free time!" Marsilio joked, drinking some Equestrian soda. He was in the cafeteria with Jachs, who's first response was something along the lines of "and I still had cousins", but he decided not to say it out loud. Lunchtime was the only time in his life it was socially acceptable to just talk, and he wouldn't spoil it. Marsilio continued. "Well, since I'm in town now, mind if I ask you something a bit above my pay grade, as it were?"\n\n"Depends on the question." Jachs responded.\n\n"Well, the blood for Project Michael - that's the one where we're trying to create a new changeling archmage - that comes from the caves under this city, right?" Marsilio looked at Jachs expectantly. "I could tell because the blood carried traces of crystal magic when we tested it. A kind of crystal we can only get from in those caves."\n\nJachs stared at him dubmly. "Marsilio, what in the Queen's name are you talking about?"\n\nThe minister was taken aback. "You don't know about Michael? Guess it leapfrogged past you. That's what that pony archmage you have locked in the Canterlot caves is for. We're trying to use archmage blood to make a new changeling archmage, I'm not sure why you don't already know but you should."\n\nJachs recalled back to Dieter's security request, which came back a third time with the Queen's royal seal and a story about a secret listening post. It was seeming like that explanation was a lie. "No, I've heard nothing of the sort about any of that. And I always doubted the Great Marsh could do something so worthwhile, anways."\n\nMarsilio took the joke and decided to focus on that, instead of the fact that he had accidentally divulged a huge amount of classified information accidentally."

His deferral of Dieter's request gave him time to investigate this Project Michael business himself before the proper amount of security was in place. He could figure out what the hell was going on in his caves fairly easily, considering the reported amount of current security being subpar. There was only the matter of doing it, which was a big problem. It was definitely possible, but it was also definitely violating the spirit of things, and the Queen was not one for legalist technicalities.\n\nBut at the same time, there was a pony down there, and a powerful one. It was not only his business to know, it was his duty. That pony was his subject! Getting too close to his populace aside, he couldn't just let a probably-innocent pony get drained by the Vhy in whatever exorbitant way those psycopaths were doing it simply because he himself was scared. That was not how he had been taught to look after his soldiers, and he wasn't going to lose the habit now.\n\nThe point was, no matter what he did, he had to make a decision one way or the other, to either take the leap and see what's going on or to just trust those in charge and forget the whole thing. And he hated putting himself at risk just as much as he hated letting a stranger be subjected to the Vhy's torture.

Queen Chysalis thanked him for being trusting, and apologized for Dieter's rude demands which were entirely within Jachs' purview to know fully about.\n\nWhat it also had was the missing explanation. Apparently, the labcoats had determined that the extensive systems of magical crystals could be used as a listening post to spy on other nation's atomic programs with extreme detail. It had a sister location in Soryth, and the reason Dieter had not thought to share this with Jachs is because it was an ultra-top-secret program.\n\nWith that resolved, Jachs felt a lot better about having let the request go through, especially since he had received a promise that such a miscommunication wouldn't happen again.\n\nIn truth, his biggest feeling was surprise. The Vhy normally did research around things like trying to find an entrance to the center of the planet, or creating magical portals, or some baffling uses for rockets. An actual sensor array with direct utility was more of a VOPS thing. He assumed there was some reason for this. Maybe it would have been revealed if Dieter had done his job properly the first time?"

changelings_paxchrysalia.91.t:0 "The Eyes that Pry" 
changelings_paxchrysalia.91.d:0 "Major-General Jachs, the desk-pilot he was, was already seeing the flaw in his plan after the short wing-flight to the cave entrance on the upper southern Canterhorn. The sole guard, in a heavily-camouflaged observation post a short distance from the maw, was a Lieutenant who waved him down as he got close. If it seemed like overkill to have a Lieutenant guarding a cave entrance that never gets used, especially since she herself never did this kind of work except for this one moonless night, it had nothing at all to do with her being part of Jachs' command chain since before the war.\n\nHe landed near her and straightened his coat. It was not his dress coat, but a more practical attire, complete with a few bags of equipment. Best of all was a map. Ponies had loved the Canterlot caves, and they had mapped the entire thing densely to rescue trapped explorer-tourists and find the best material with ease. The Lieutenant saluted and said, "Don't do anything stupid." He saluted back, nodding, before venturing into the cave. It was a long way to go, and he only had one night.\n\nAs he passed the mouth, his eyes began to adjust to the darkness. By design, the night sky hurt his eyes and made distant objects fuzzy and discolored, but the pitch-blackness of the stone tunnel was free from the influence of Princess Luna, and he had no trouble navigating it by sight, instinct, and map. It almost felt like home, bringing back memories of youthful visits to the central Hive-construction of Vraks. Compared to that glorious spire, his own headquarters was too random, too perfectly curved and artful and off-consistent, he decided. This cave was the opposite. His path down often took him up, around, or perfectly vertical. It was chaotic. It was natural. He had to put those thoughts out of his head as he approached the area where the Vhy's few nighttime guards patrolled. He couldn't be distracted."

changelings_paxchrysalia.92.t:0 "Metamorphosis"
changelings_paxchrysalia.92.d:0 "In ten hours, or a single one according to Jachs' watch, he entered the final chamber of his journey. His blood was still pumping from his encounter with the guard some time ago, even though in retrospect the overworked thing would never have thought to check Jachs' hiding spot. His concerns were only being put to rest by him being at the point of no return. There was no excuse to go back earlier yet empty-hooved now.\n\nThe chamber was large, with bright yellow crystals covering nearly half of it floor-to-ceiling. Aetherial mist drifted from the tips of the spikes into a bright yellow cocoon in the center that lit the room in stark shadows. Thin plastic cables fell from the thing, one filled with red and the other with IV fluid, and ran into a series of boxes. Consoles and machinery were scattered around the geode, powering and controlling the apparatus.\n\nIt took Jachs a while to gain the courage to touch any of it, in case one of the Vhy guards suddenly revealed himself from underneath the power supply and declared his adventure over. When he had spent too long just staring at it, working out what each button probably did, he finally swallowed his fear and stepped close. To turn the machine off was a single switch, the rest were to change settings. It was not even a large switch. Whatever was being held in the cocoon was clearly too dangerous to merit ceremony in keeping it locked away. An archmage would merit that. If they got out and were angry, who could stop them? It would take a small army. And Jachs was about to release this one intentionally. Point of no return, point of no return, point of no return...\n\nHe flipped the switch. The light in the room dimmed immensely as the forcefield fell and took the brightness of the crystals with it. A limp, skinny thing fell out, landing on the ground with a flat thump. Jachs looked closer at his new friend, saw a pair of wings, and regretted ever coming down here."

changelings_paxchrysalia.93.d:0 "Jachs fearfully eyed the thing before him. It was a unicorn, and it had wings. The horn had the most complex anti-magic device Jachs had ever seen, and every limb had some sort of metal cuff with a yellow gem embedded in it that was slowly glowing more faintly. What remained of its fur was purple, and there was a coloration of stars on its flank. Its Jachs was looking at Princess Twilight Sparkle, or at least what was left.\n\nThoughts were racing through his mind. Was it a trick? Was he just wrong? Princess Twilight had died abord the H.M.S. Amacitas en-route to New Mareland, hadn't she? Why didn't Dieter think he should know about this, hell, why didn't the Queen? And just what was he doing down here, anyways?\n\nPrincess Twilight stirred. Jachs jumped, and instincts took over. When she opened her reddened eyes and sat up, she found a changeling she'd never seen before, alone, in cave-crawling gear, saluting her perfectly. "At... ease?" She cautiously said. Jachs forced his arm down.\n\n"Sorry, ma'am, old habit." Jachs said sheepishly. "I was not expecting a Princess."\n\n"And I was not expecting to wake up to getting saluted by a changeling." Twilight propped herself up against a nearby crystal with great effort. "Ow. What's with that? Are you a Thoraxian they missed?"\n\nJachs' worry was replaced with indignation. "No, and don't suggest that again. I'm being polite because you're royalty, and we take that seriously."\n\nTwilight's brow furrowed. "From what I heard, your kind had nothing but disdain for Princess Celestia."\n\n"Of course we do," Jachs replied. "Princess Celestia is not royalty. She is a god. Her kind hates our kind, and we hate them back."\n\nTwilight thought for a minute. "That... explains a lot, actually." Jachs realized that he had yet to hear any hatred or malice in her voice, or taste it in her feelings. Only strain from her precarious health. She turned to him and asked, "What's your name?""

"The rank is a holdover, my true title is 'Minister of Central Equestria'." He produced a card which, in flowery Equestrian letters, harsh Changeling squares, and royal seal, stated just that. "You might know that ministers have ultimate power within their domains. Well, you're in my domain, and somehow I found out someone was here last week and found out you were still alive just now."\n\n"And you came down here, yourself, alone, because you just had to know what was going on in your domain?" Twilight chuckled, earning a slight glare from Jachs. "You know, if I wanted to spread harmony, someone with that level of care and attention is who I'd want."\n\n"I'm not going to betray my Queen, if that's what you're suggesting." Jachs replied with annoyance.\n\n"Not 'Harmony' with a capital H, Jachs. The thought itself. The one that makes you check up on a friend who you haven't seen in a while to make sure they're okay, the kind which makes ponies - or changelings - pick up litter even while alone in the woods. That's a good habit to get into." Twilight was smiling. "Honestly, I was worried that the same bugs who've been starving me for fun were the ones in charge up there."\n\nIgnoring the casual slur, Jachs changed the topic. "I should mention now that I can't get you out of here. You're in no position to walk, and I can't carry you."\n\nTwilight sighed. "I guessed. Well, I wouldn't want to undo whatever happened to give you some real power. Mind giving me some water before you put me back in?"" Jachs obliged her, and she drank from his canteen eagerly. He flipped the switch that powered the crystals once more, levitating her back into her cocoon via the metal bands she wore.

At least he got to have the second part of the day off to study.\n\nWhen he returned to his office, he was greeted by Lieutenant Alcippe. She was usually cheerful, but once the two were alone, there was a slight dimming. In his cramped underground station, she closed the door behind them and asked, "So what were you doing the night you came down with that stuff?"\n\n"I'm not sure. I woke up fully-dressed, and my legs hurt like I'd been walking for hours, but I don't remember any of it. I think I sleptwalk all night and was just exhausted." It was not a good lie, but it covered all his bases unless he had been seen doing something which was already inherently incriminating. So, he added with a conspiratorial glance, "Truth be told, this job is getting to me more than I'd like to admit."\n\nAlcippe had stresses of her own, and could understand the effect that an even higher position would have. Still, she was his lieutenant. "Well, that's not good. If it becomes a habit, we'll have to do something about it. Is there anything I can do to help?"\n\n"Nothing that you don't already do, but if I think of anything else I'll say so." Jachs said. Alcippe was a good girl. It was a shame he didn't know if he could trust her with what he knew.\n\nAnd so the two went their separate ways, each tending to their position in the massive bureaucracy of the Central Equestrian region. Occupied by the rigors of his work and Princess Twilight Sparkle's words, he was in no position to notice that he was being watched by more of his co-workers than usual."

His guards were easy to navigate past if you already knew their patrol like he did, which was how he had slipped out. Once he had gotten back in, he raced to a desk in a study that he nearly never used for lack of time. In one of the drawers were dossiers on every one of the Element-Bearers. He'd been following the updates, but never read the full versions.\n\nOnce he had found it from where it had gotten buried, he skimmed one, and then the next, and then the next. None of them had that critical line, "Her ideas can be found in so-and-so book published that year, find it at..." In fact, thinking back, there was no series of speeches or pamphlets or much of anything which described the harmonic principles outside of the Thoraxians, and who would want to be one of them? Was international Harmony really little more than imitating Celestia and these six young adults? He had had a taste of it, he needed more than that!\n\nHis last hope fell on Princess Twilight's journal, which was currently at a location somewhere between "unknown" and "classified".\n\nSo it looked like he was on his own."

He only knew about it at all because Dieter Heinrich was chosen to do HIS job, and performed his duties with his characteristic brick-like grace. Why was he the one running the show at all? In this matter, the only thing Dieter had to offer was a guarantee of not complaining when given an order he should know better than to follow.\n\nJachs tore up the dozens of pages of theorycrafting and plots, and threw it all into the fireplace. There was nothing to be done for now, but that would change. He would remember how his Queen thought of him and his loyalty."

## Castle of Friendship ##
changelings_paxchrysalia.200.t:0 "How Long Is a Week?"
changelings_paxchrysalia.200.d:0 "Captain Dieter sat at Major-General Jach's desk. There was some sort of report in front of him, talking about a spate of Thestral crimes spilling into Canterlot's nicer districts. To Dieter's mind, the solution was simple, and he wrote, "Henceforth, any Thestral caught committing a violent crime is to become the property of the victim's household. Signed, Acting Minister Dieter Heinrich." Jach's job was a lot easier than it looked.\n\nSpeaking of which, he had just appeared in the door. "Hello, Major-General. How was the movie?" Dieter asked in his best cordial voice. Jachs had earned a vacation, and had used it to visit a friend who was making a comedy film. Apparently he had been allowed to direct a few scenes.\n\nJachs glared at Dieter. "It was nice, Captain, now what are you doing in my chair?"\n\nDieter explained, "Well, you left Alcippe in charge, but some business with the Queen forced her to vacate to Ponyville to help oversee something. Ministers Finicus and Marsilio are in Vesalipolis, your third-in-command is in the hospital, and your fourth-in-command is that far down for a reason, so she placed me in charge."\n\nJachs replied, "That makes sense. You're off the hook. Now get out of my chair, I've got a load of debris to clean up." Dieter obliged. Jachs sat down after him, took one look at what the Captain had been working on, and threw it into the trash the instant he was out of the room.\n\nJust as he was getting comfortable to untangle whatever knot had tied itself in his administration, Dieter came back just to say, "I'll warn you, whatever is going on is beyond our comprehension as mere drones." So he thought Jachs couldn't understand it. That was either a good sign (Dieter didn't understand it because it was too clever), or a bad sign (Dieter didn't understand it because it made no sense)."

changelings_paxchrysalia.201.t:0 "Untanglement"
changelings_paxchrysalia.201.d:0 "The Major-General sat comfortable at his own desk in his own office once again, and after looking over only yesterday's paperwork, he was thoroughly cured of ever wanting to leave. Dieter had done a good enough job summarizing, collating, concatenating, all the things which were the busywork of the position. It was when he had to think that the problems came. Every decision he himself made was some new flavor of awful, usually being pointless, unacceptably bigoted, or both.\n\nJachs was lucky that sending out the forms had been reserved for the real governor's return. At least Dieter knew better than to use his three days of power to do anything.\n\nThe next step was figuring out where Alcippe was. This turned out to be easier than expected. Knowing the day she walked off wasn't as useful as it might seem, but the trail of paperwork detailing significant military hardware being sent to Ponyville for no clear reason (with the scale of the operation shrinking as he looked further back) gave him an idea.\n\nHis confirmation of the most recent request, a call for multiple batteries of lightning tanks, was therefore denied, along with a politely-worded demand for her to return to her office at once to explain herself. Truthfully, a call for that many lightning tanks would have been denied no matter what. The things weigh three digits of tons and are used to wipe out entire tank columns and city blocks in one shot. Even one was so expensive to field, and what possible use could she have for EIGHT? An angry skyscraper? Whatever it was, it was total nonsense, and he was disappointed in Alcippe for falling to it.\n\nImagine his shock when what he got back from the radiomail office was the same request for lightning tanks, confirmed by Queen Chrysalis's seal and signature."
changelings_paxchrysalia.201.a:0 "Okay, what is this?"

changelings_paxchrysalia.202.t:0 "Chain of Command"
changelings_paxchrysalia.202.d:0 "After taking another six hours to unravel the mystery of the colossal amount of military hardware concentrated in Ponyville, Jachs found patient zero: a document that came in the day after he left requesting him to shift a trainload of explosives to Ponyville in order to destroy the Castle of Friendship, as well as requesting his presence to help smooth the process along. Alcippe, acting in his stead, went. Then requested a second trainload of explosives. Then a massive amount of artillery. Then a railway cannon. Then the eight lightning tanks, currently on their way because the Queen was also still there personally. Why? To visibly crush a symbol of Equestrian Resistance, which was the first Jachs had heard about it since the castle wasn't a decade old and barely anyone had seen it. Dieter had been dumbly letting the orders go through, but even he could tell that this was a huge mess with no purpose.\n\nThe pinch was that this affair couldn't go on due to the immense cost in money and publicity. Jachs hadn't been reading the news to get away from politics for his vacation, but apparently the quest to blow up the castle was front-page news every day on every paper. This affair also couldn't stop because Queen Chrysalis was there to order it restarted.\n\nThat was why the order for lightning tanks had been quietly re-routed to somewhere completely different. He hoped that a bit of time to cool off and hear his version of things would let the Queen dissuade herself of whatever she had gotten into her head. All he had to do was wait for the notice that it didn't arrive, so he could bring up his concerns. This kind of thing was his domain for a reason.\n\nHis temporary secretary came in and left a note. Apparently, a recent order for lightning tanks had been sent to Ponyville, but nearly ended up in some dead-end junction, and the local governor was checking in to inform Jachs that he'd corrected the clerical error."

changelings_paxchrysalia.203.t:0 "The Queen's Word"
changelings_paxchrysalia.203.d:0 "Jachs walked, grumbling, back to his office. On every side, ponies and changelings were selling newspapers depicting the impressive lightshow that had been given to the Castle of Friendship and left it unscathed. The next request from the Queen? An incredible amount of anti-fortification air-dropped ordinance. As in, he didn't know that they had that much.\n\nThat wasn't the only reason to sulk. He was coming back from a meeting with the regional organizer for the VOPS, an uncomfortable role with a uniquely uncomfortable changeling in it. Jachs had decided to try and call in the heavy-hitters to frustrate this ridiculous operation, and the VOPS seemed apolitical enough and yet powerful enough to influence it. He had planned to talk to their boss, but somehow couldn't figure out who it was, and to make matters worse, when he went to the local head, he said he didn't have the authority OR the desire to help circumvent the Queen's word. And probably reported the conversation as a sign of possible disloyalty. So it was a negative on all fronts.\n\nWhen he reached the Canterlot Castle basement, he slumped into his chair and stared at the ceiling. What to do? He was between a flood and a cave-in, with only one action he could take that led to no difference from if he had done nothing. His secretary came in and said, "Mister Jachs? There was a call for you from Queen Argynnis. She's waiting for you to get back to her."\n\n"Thank you," he replied before putting the receiver to his ear. As soon as he heard the click of his call being routed to Argynnis's personal phone, he started. "Hello, my-"\n\nA loud, tinny shriek came through the speaker. "MINSTER JACHS! I JUST GOT A REQUEST LABELLED "SHALL ACCEPT" FOR FIFTY-PERCENT OF OUR NATION'S BUNKER BUSTERS COMING FROM YOUR REGION, AND ALL I GET WHEN I ASK WHYYY YOU NEED THIS IS SOME BUILDING I'VE NEVER HEARD OF! WHAT ARE YOU CLOWNS DOING OVER THERE!?" Jachs smiled to himself."

changelings_paxchrysalia.204.t:0 "Meeting of the Minds"
changelings_paxchrysalia.204.d:0 "The Ponyville civilian airport was a relatively small and recent thing, being only barely paved. At least the runway was long enough for Queen Argynnis's private jet. It was a miracle of technology, and for a brief period, the largest jet plane on the continent, and the Queen of Vraks was proud of it. It made her security depressed, however, since every time she flew in it they would take bets to see if this was the one where the thing finally fell apart mid-air and killed her. Jachs thought it would be this flight, but no, apparently it was always that shaky.\n\nThe glory of stepping off the plane to meet Queen Chrysalis on the tarmac was dented by the aircraft's passenger compartment being only large enough for Argynnis and maybe two drones, but the tension was still palpable. Argynnis almost appeared as tall as Chrysalis from her indignation at being dragged out for this as she stopped in front of the supermonarch.\n\nChrysalis began, hiding her annoyance at the entire ordeal. "You didn't need to come all the way out for this. It's a media circus as-is."\n\nArgynnis was not entertained. "On the contrary, from the sound of it, you need someone to slap some sense into you face-to-face." Jachs stepped away to join Dieter off to the side, watching the spectacle. "I was reading about the Castle of Friendship on the way. Turns out there's nearly no real literature about it. Fancy that, for a major symbol of Equestria!"\n\nChrysalis tried to speak up, but Argynnis continued. "I found a lot of newspapers, though. And who did I see but Twilight Sparkle, sister of that dirty thing who's love thrashed you soundly in 1002? And the rest of the swine six too, who resisted you so heavily during the war and after?"\n\nChrysalis's hooves were digging into the dirt. She could kill Argynnis right now, but the fallout would be too much. "Wherever you're going with this, can you please hurry up?""

changelings_paxchrysalia.205.d:0 ""The point, and the thing that dragged me all the way out here, is that the Queen of Queens, Mother of Lies and Lord of All She Surveys, is once again embarrassing our proud nation, and this time she doesn't have the decency to do it in front of only her entire council. You are not getting so many of our hard-earned bombs to pursue whatever petty vendetta you've gotten embedded inside of you, and you will stop disrespecting your titles and acting like a child. That is all." Argynnis turned and walked back to her jet, nodding to the pilot to start spooling the engines up again.\n\nQueen Chrysalis stood, trying to hold back the rage. It was just lucky for her that, for safety reasons, very few were close enough to the tarmac to hear the exchange. She called to Argynnis, "So what do you say we do about the castle?"\n\nArgynnis shouted back over the whine of the jet engines, "I don't know! Throw a tarp over it, if you must! Minister Jachs, would you like me to take you back to Canterlot?"\n\n"No thank you, my Queen!" Jachs screamed forcefully. He was taking a car back. He turned to Queen Chrysalis and said, "I would like to go over a few plans to repurpose that castle. We have researchers who are stretching their leashes to try and figure it out, and the army would adore such a strong building to headquarter in..."\n\nChrysalis looked immensely disappointed. "Nothing could compare to seeing that tower of ponykind levelled."\n\n"Maybe so," Jachs offered, "but we're Changelings. Taking from other races and using for ourselves is our way, is it not?"\n\nThe Queen sighed, her pride appeased but not satiated. "You're right. Do whatever you feel is best." Jachs saluted, and went to track down Alcippe. He suddenly had a lot of work to do, arranging a research mission and moving the regional command center into the once-mothballed fortress of friendliness. Tedious work, but it would be nice to not have to worry about the damned thing anymore."

Jachs was in disbelief at what the commander of the Castle of Friendship garrison was asking for. A full retreat? Because of poltergeistery?\n\nThe tinny voice said, "It's true, sir. One of the science team got trapped in a hallway when a door locked itself behind him, we're going through food like crazy because meat spoils overnight no matter what we do, a sergeant threw up red blood out of nowhere, and a couple of the soldiers swear on their lives that they've caught the ghost of Pinkie Pie watching them sleep."\n\nJachs took a second to groan and put his head in his hooves. This Castle was now his problem, and he was drowning in it. "I can't believe this is my job. Alright, here's what you do. Spend another day in, then put up a lot of tarps so that the entire building is hidden. If anyone asks, the place is becoming classified, and nobody's allowed in or out except through secret passages, but don't be so obvious about it. Then slip out in the night, and make sure you aren't seen. That should evacuate the building without calling all the nonsense I had to deal with back."\n\n"Sir! Thank you, sir!" The telephone nearly shouted. "You have no idea how relieved I am to hear you not just telling us to push through it!"\n\n"Don't thank me, commander, thank the team of black-operations guys who will come in after you to make sure the place is as bad as you say it is. Because if they don't, this is getting treated as a truly dire case of insubordination. Are we clear?" Jachs heard silence on the line. Just when he thought the commander would reveal the deception, the answer he was hoping against arrived."

He'd asked why Trimmel was calling for such a massive movement of troops overland, and sitting before him was the reason, in all of its painful misery. Colossal stockpiles of wartime weaponry, unfathomably large black markets, anti-government societies formed behind closed doors... Jachs knew exactly what he was looking at. "Why are they doing this? They've lived through the war, they had that Stalliongrad business not long ago, why do they think that turning the country into a disaster will help anything?"\n\nTrimmel was reclined in the chair across from him, being the bearer of bad news despite a smile that stretched from wall to wall. "Chaos in the streets, families killing families, siblings killing siblings, the strong doing as they please as the weak do as they must... Jachs, friend, I would have expected you to get it. They're ponies. They think we're guests, and they want us to feel at home." He laughed cruelly.\n\nJachs glared. "This isn't a game, Hive's Marshall. If we can't stop this, hundreds of thousands will die, if not millions."\n\n"That's a low estimate. It assumes we win!" Trimmel laughed again. "You should see the nonsense I have to do to entertain myself now that we're at peace! I'm looking forwards to the hunter-bombers having targets to feed on again. And what great enemies these ponies will be! Give them some 'revolutionary literature' and suddenly they're on a mission, and you can't persuade them to turn away with such trivialities like survival or the fact that their plan will make everything worse for everyone."\n\n"Damnit, I wish I could disagree." Jachs bemoaned. "What are we going to do?"\n\n"Same thing as always. Prepare, build up defenses, then kill everyone." Trimmel got out of his chair.

changelings_paxchrysalia.401.d:0 "To Minister of Central Equestria, Jachs N. Vrak\n\n     Our attempts to infiltrate the resistance cells of Equestria to dismantle them has hit a snag. That being that they are continually multiplying, and we do not have enough infiltrators to take them apart. The organizations are also growing, making it even harder. Common complaints include authoritarianism, tyranny, the devaluation of individual life under our system, and most of all the reinstitution of slavery.\n\n     As this has expanded beyond our ability to manage, and likely anyone's, we will instead shift to trying to map out the groups as much as possible in order to discern leaders and major figures as well as each group's penetration into the local area so that the proper authorities can easier deal with it once the situation becomes chaotic.\n\n     We officially recommend that your own strategy shift as soon as possible and as much as possible towards preventing and mitigating the effects of a large-scale uprising, which we believe to be approaching rapidly. In such cases where this fails, the solution may be military in nature. The dangerous groups in question are showing both a wide variety of ideologies as well as a remarkable amount of unity, and therefore terrible things may happen in the event of failure.\n\n     Sincerely, the High Council of the V.O.P.S."

changelings_paxchrysalia.402.d:0 "Deceptively few changelings had been on board the transport plane. Although it normally seated twenty-four, only half that in panzersoldiers had walked off. Maybe it was the weight of their extra armor and their heavy weapons, maybe it was just that wearing it made them take up so much more space. Jach's own bodyguards numbered about as much, but were far smaller. The panzersoldiers trudged roughly over the tarmac, fighting against the immense amount of steel they were carrying. Jachs saluted. They nodded back, not having the mobility to return the full ceremony. They were only designed to have to move one city block at a time, so mobility wasn't important for them. Canterlot had been recieving extra shipments of them all week. The V.O.P.S. didn't think that the city would be safe for much longer. Towns were falling silent all over the country, and full deployment of the Heer's entire arsenal was already authorized.\n\nBefore he walked onto the plane himself to be taken back to Vesalipolis, he turned to Lieutenant Alcippe. "I wish I had more help I could give you," he said.\n\n"There's enough already, Major-General. We'll hold out, if we have to hide in the caves. You don't need to worry about me." She replied with a smile of small comfort to him. It was better than nothing, though.\n\nJachs started on the walk to the plane, its engines still running and its last cargo of files and decoders being stowed on board. He turned and called back, "Here's hoping it doesn't come to that." He knew that his soldiers came first, but Canterlot was a beautiful city. From what he'd read, he appreciated how untouched by the war it was more than the upcoming rebellion did.\n\nHe had sharpened his fangs as an officer fighting insurgents around Lyctida.

Around him flowed changeling bureaucrats and officials who hadn't been deemed combat-viable and had thusly been evacuated, although many were still visibly armed. Now, the Second War was over, and Jachs was once again entering Canterlot to view his conquest now that it was safe. Last time, he had overseen the taking of the weapons of the existing garrison. This time, any "existing enemy garrison" was either dead or soon to be.\n\nThe first thing he noticed was that the airship station, once a shining beacon of modern architecture, was now sitting with every single window broken and spent casings in the ditches. He saw that before he saw Alcippe in the crowd. "Welcome back, sir," she said as she navigated to him.\n\n"I read your reports on the conflict. Are you okay?" Jachs asked, looking around worriedly. This terminal was still standing, and that made it lucky among the city's buildings.\n\n"I'm fine, sir." Alcippe answered as she took the sword off of her belt and gave it to a bodyguard, now that Jachs was back and she was a civilian officer again. "Most of the soldiers made it out alright, too. The bad guys didn't, and... well, the city didn't." The pair set out off the docks and on the way to Canterlot Castle, one of the few untouched locations from being deep behind the perimeter.\n\nThere were ponies inside of the airport station, and every single one looked scared to be in this city. Jachs didn't blame them. The reports reminded him of Lyctida. "Are the locals going to be okay? It sounds like the city went through a lot." He asked.\n\n"I wish I knew. The ones on staff are alive, but they've been kind of quiet ever since the shooting started." Alcippe explained. "It's eerie. I didn't realize how much I got used to the sound of them talking amongst themselves. Now they blend in with the changelings."

Always going on about how things were in it homeland, how glad it was that "the right side won", showing off its wartime rifle which any pony would have been arrested for having unless they got down and licked the jackboots... He'd made sure to mention that rifle when he mentioned it to the freedom fighters.\n\nThe car had arrived seconds ago and already it was being dragged out. If it had been looking up, instead of trying to fight against the two freedom fighters restraining it, the accountant would have smiled and waved sarcastically. Instead, he just chuckled to himself as a prybar came out and smashed the bug in the head for being too unruly. The noise drew in pedestrians as the crew dragged it into the middle of the street and one of them started preaching from atop the car. Whatever worked for them, the accountant supposed. He was just happy to see things start going back to how they were supposed to be.\n\nThe happy feeling started to disappear when he, along with the gathering crowd, watched one of the freedom fighters. They were going to expel the bug, right? Why was he dousing it in gasoline, right there in the road? He stared, his smile replaced with dread, but he didn't know for what. That was a good, Equestrian pony down there, right? What did he have to be scared of?\n\nThe gasoline revitalized the bug, who started scrambling to get up and flee, but it was too late for him. The spectators jumped back as the fighter dropped a match, and he burst into orange flames and screamed. By Celestia, he screamed. The preacher kept preaching as he ran down the street, screaming.

Ponies were always sloppy with these things. The duo who were hiding behind it popped up from behind it and opened fire, one with a cheap submachine gun and another with a bolt-action rifle. Bullets ricocheted off of his chestplate and his shoulder-board plates as he raised his MG00 and sent twenty rounds down the hall, causing the rebels to fall apart into a pile of red mush.\n\nThe table had been erected to protect a door midway down the hall from him and his team, who were trudging behind him. The rifle-bearer took his axe, the head already stained red from the previous floor's adventures, and chopped the table into smaller pieces. The panzersoldier trudged over the debris and meaty chunks like he trudged everywhere in his heavy armor, and took up position besides the door, his compariots taking the other side or watching the hall's ends. The ally smashed around the handle with the axe, then smashed the door in. A hail of gunfire erupted out and he recoiled from it. "At least a dozen in there!" He yelled in Changeling. "I only saw some with weapons!"\n\nIt would have been a tense situation. The bad guys had hostages, they had a prepared defense... Unfortunately, the panzersoldier recalled the poster he'd seen growing up in Thoraxian territory, training for counter-terror, and recently, translated into Equestrian and placed around Canterlot: "If there are rebel fighters in the building, there are only rebel fighters in the building." He pulled the cap off of a stick grenade, opened the door for a brief moment, and threw it in.\n\nThere was a loud bang, and he charged into the dirty and cloudy room, his mask filtering out the carnage, but nothing was moving.

The latter was something entirely seperate to be proud of, and in a way it made Jach's mind feel nothing but sadness that it would never have been an achievement of his own kind. Anyways, now it was a weapon.\n\nThe river, among other things, fed the Everfree Forest. "Fed" was a funny word, since it didn't need water or soil or much of anything. Really, it ran through the Everfree Forest. And there, it was feeding the water needs of thousands of rebels who were hiding in it.\n\nDams like these were part of how the rebels were defeated. The Everfree seemed hostile to changelings specifically, but they didn't need to enter to attack. They dammed up every river, poisoned the groundwater, had pegasi cease and desist all rain to the area, set aside flights of dive bombers to blow up any signs of organized life, and then, they erected a giant cordon and waited. The moisture from the Everfree's plants wasn't safe to make an entire diet from for normal sentients, and eventually, the enemies inside seemingly all perished of thirst, disease, or rushing the barrier.\n\nJachs stood beside the dam's manager, looking out across the beautiful plains and seeing in the foggy distance the edge of the forest.

If viewed alongside the host taken after the war, one might ask, "why so few?" After seeing the lengths changeling rebels would go to avoid capture and considering that ponies could flee to any number of sympathetic countries, Chrysalis asked herself, "why so many?"\n\n"The obvious thing is the public execution." Queen Argynnis explained in Equestrian for the benefit of their guests. "It's vivid. Simple. Proven."\n\n"Yes, but I do like options. Minister Jachs recommended a fully Equestrian private execution. It had a few things going for it. Those who like us won't change their minds over it, most importantly." Chrysalis looked at another leader, who seemed far too young for the authority they had briefly held.\n\n"Equestrian-style?" Argynnis questioned. "We do not have a single hanging expert on our staff."\n\n"That's another advantage." Chrysalis replied. She was enjoying tasting the fear, and could definitely taste the burst of courage that arose as one of the ponies behind her mumbled "monsters". Her magic lashed out, and she found herself with a tongue in her ethereal grasp. Looking at the offender, blood drooling from his mouth as he tried not to scream in pain, she joked, "How were you ever going to succeed if I can even hold your tongue better than you?"\n\nShe tossed the limp meat to Captain Dieter, who grunted at the trail of blood dripping down his hoof and onto his coat, and flung it to one of the guards. "You can get the best of both worlds by sending them all to the far north to let the Dennites play with them." He said dryly.\n\n"But then we can't prove they're dead." Chrysalis replied.\n\n"Then send their entire household. Everyone will understand that message." He suggested. He nodded at the guard, who was staring at him hesitantly, and she dropped the tongue into her mouth and ate it."

changelings_paxchrysalia.411.d:0 "Major-General Jachs paced in one of the Catnerlot Castle's many archive/museum rooms, considering the issue before him as he walked back and forth. It felt... dirty, and not in an industrial way.\n\nThe problem was that the rebels had one demographic which was over-represented in the rebellion, and especially in every "dangerous" category. It was Equestrian veterans of the war. This was a problem because they were all repeat offenders. At the end of the war, Equestrian soldiers who could not be captured for one reason or another were made to turn in their equipment and then set free, including the entire army at once when Equestria surrendered, painlessly sparing many of bondage.\n\nTens of thousands now sat in camps, in prisons, in dungeons, and wherever else space could be found, all waiting for a decision to be made about what to do with them who had betrayed their own country by not accepting its surrender.\n\nJachs already knew that his word on the subject would carry a lot of weight because of his job. He also knew that cruelty would be popular among Chrysalis's council, so the answer would default to the execution of the entire 60,000-strong lot. That was one way to ensure that they would not be defeated a third time. Jachs didn't feel comfortable about that, but the only alternative he could justify was blinding, which was more painful and just as permanent as a bullet to the head.\n\nIf only they could be put into servitude like the previous Equestrian soldiers, but Finicus was clear that that was a bad idea. There were already more slaves than was economically-efficient, adding 60,000 more would be worthless. What would they do?\n\nJachs stopped pacing in front of a window. Canterlot, once untouched by way of convenient equinitarian crisis, now sat with over a third reduced to rubble in the view. It was not unique. It would be poetic to make the second wave of soldier-prisoners clean up their own mess. But would it be a good idea?"

changelings_paxchrysalia.412.d:0 "Jachs stared out the window of his car as he drove down the roads of Canterlot. Out the window were the first construction crews, rebuilding the city one sidewalk at a time. He watched them, and the other ponies, go about their business whenever his car was stopped by a red light or a sidewalk. He couldn't help but wonder idly how many in any given group had been spotters for the rebels, or had given money or other material, or had operated safehouses, or had been fighters.\n\nThere were untold thousands who had simply gone back to civilian life afterwards. They only got turned in by their co-species if they had been downright intolerable during the days of chaos. And yet it was through them most of all that chaos had taken the land formerly known as Equestria. And now many would get to live in the nation they shaped.\n\nJach's newest issue to weigh in on was these ponies, who had helped the revolution but likely would not have were there no revolution to help. Voices clamored to have them hunted like dogs, to keep it the doctrine that revolution be a jailable offense at minimum. Others instead supported the tested solution of a showy clemency that covers for lack of ability.\n\nDieter was pushing for some utter nonsense about collective punishments. More folks than usual were listening. As in, more than his coworkers. A century of experience had taught everyone who mattered that collective punishments only caused embitterment. It was obvious if you thought about it, but Dieter was, as usual, controlled by his mental problems and unhealthy love of amphetamines.\n\nJachs rubbed his chin. Arrests and lenience were simply both means to an end - control. Put some harsh restriction on a hamlet that resisted more than they should have, and you anger them. Give them an easy path back to normality, and the effect is lessened. But what if the true punishment was the reward? Reduce their diet to hay alone, then offer other flavors back to them... with a chemical twist."

Even when his reasons were sound, Captain Dieter was a pain.\n\nThere was the noise of someone walking up to him. Captain Second Wind stood besides him and began, "I didn't get the chance to mention this earlier, sir, but I'd like to thank you. Off the record, that is, this isn't work-related."\n\n"Well, you're welcome. What did I do?" Jachs asked idly.\n\nSecond Wind steeled himself, causing Jachs to reevaluate his expectations. "I have a cousin who was in one of the anti-changeling militias. He's not in jail right now, apparently because you made a very persuasive argument for forgiveness. So... thanks. He's too good a kid to wind up in jail over this."\n\nJachs turned it over in his head. "Is he thankful for it, too?"\n\n"Oh, hell no." Second Wind said. "He'll wish he was in jail once I'm done with him. Point is, he'll be set straight by his own relatives, rather than get maimed some guard who secretly hates everyone with red blood or spend the rest of his life scared of that."\n\n"Rightfully so, on all counts.

He supposed that maybe they were used to the heat, and so they just became cold. Oh well. More for him whenever he left his office in the rain.\n\nThere was the noise of someone walking up to him.

You've known soldiers who spent a bit too much time with their combat stimulants, right?"\n\n"Too many. What about it?" Jachs asked.\n\n"What does your state do with them when they stop being in the army?" Second Wind asked cautiously.\n\nJachs figured out how to formulate his answer. "Well, the science is still being developed on these specific drugs, but between pensions and other veteran's benefits, it's designed to be easy to readjust to life without them. Usually, you get a pack of pills to help the withdrawal, and then lock yourself in your room for a month while a friend or relative delivers you food. Why do you ask?"\n\n"Well," Second Wind hesitated, "My cousin came for a family dinner recently, and I think he's on some of it. He was a bit... odd, and refused to let anyone touch a case of government soda his village was sent."\n\nJachs hid the grimace at the mention of the narcotic drink.

changelings_paxchrysalia.416.d:0 "In a war, you can lose land without immediately losing an advantage. You have an entire country you can retreat to and an army that can stay cohesive in the face of seeming defeat by placing their trust in their leaders. By the time Equestria stopped retreating to buy time, they were retreating because those who stood died pointlessly. The land felt some destruction, but only some. The enemy was never so entrenched that annihilation took root.\n\nThe ponies of Equestria had now fixed that oversight. The rebels often had no hope for salvation, only for delaying the changelings until something unexpected rescued them. Delay, they did. The city would be taken, but some neighborhoods would be safe, and others would be made so street by bloody street. When the panzersoldiers were unavailable, the bombers and cannons took up the slack. Where once city blocks had been destroyed, now entire districts lay sterile.\n\nIn other words, it was a perfect opportunity for the Changelings and their allies to show off that, despite how the rest of the world viewed them, they were more than a union of ruinous states.\n\nAs the severe damage was almost entirely in dependent Equestria, the first major related decision, like all minor related decisions before it, fell to Major-General Jachs. As he stared at the paper, the necessary construction crews were being rounded up. Once work began, it would be a massive endeavor. Somewhere, cuts had to be made so that more material could be directed to this effort. At least for the largest piece of it, he had to figure out which part of the economy would get to shoulder the extra burden."

However, the hope was dashed when he found himself standing before a pile of rubble that had once been the Bale Fortress, sitting in an open field within throwing distance of an apartment. Construction equipment sat idle nearby. The local governor began, gesturing to it. "This is the problem building. It was completely destroyed in the fighting for one reason or another. The orders say to rebuild it how it was before that, but ponies keep being mad about it and insist it was supposed to be destroyed. The managers say we can't do much with the materials if they don't get used here, but I'd like to have your word here in case we go through and it turns bad."\n\n Jachs suddenly noticed that a crowd had gathered outside the perimeter set by both official's bodyguard details. They had pre-made picket signs on this exact issue and were visibly invested in the conversation, though they couldn't have heard it well. One had taken the lead and was yelling. Jachs motioned to his guards to let that one through, and soon the young mare found herself looking down at a Minister. "Miss, I'm told that you and others have argued that this castle shouldn't be restored. Could you explain why?"\n\n"Indeed I can!" She nearly yelled. "Sorry. The thing is, this castle isn't just an old structure. A thousand years ago, during the War in the Heavens, it was a Lunarist stronghold built by a brilliant architect. Countless Solarists died to seize it, and when they did, they slaughtered everyone inside and tore it apart. We've kept it half-broken ever since as a warning against the darkness of those days." Jachs raised an eyebrow. "That's why it's important that it be rebuilt destroyed, while you want to "fix" it."

As they entered, he stood up and shouted, "Heil Chrysalis!" The three changelings heiled back, and they took seats around the room. One was Alcippe, and the other two were Economic Minister Finicus and Research Minister Marsilio, on a planned visit from Vesalipolis. "I trust that you were well-received?" He asked. He knew the answer, of course, since he had put Alcippe on the case, but it was polite.\n\nMarsilio started annoyedly. "Our guards were highly disruptive to maintain security, and the car's bomb-proofing made it uncomfortable, but any trip where nobody shoots at you is a good one." He flashed a grin to punctuate the joke. Finicus merely shrugged. "Of course, we are here on business and lunch took longer than expected, so we shouldn't dawdle."\n\nJachs replied, "Agreed. I am told that you both have proposals, alongside just being here as part of your new duties."\n\nIt was Finicus's turn to speak. "Yes. I wish to run a survey. Ponies on the streets. White-collar convicts. Low-level offenders. Normal ponies. I want to see their minds work so that I can figure out how to value them."\n\nIt seemed unusually reasonable, but he'd take it. Jachs said, "I can arrange that. And you?"\n\nMarsilio said, "I've been told to "expand" the literature on pony biology. Like, disassembling them, doing things that were illegal in Equestria. I'll need the most unmissable ponies your police have been taking under fog, the ones where you already know they're getting executed before you've even got them. Not the normal ponies." Jachs could tell that he was expecting to deal with worthless monsters, but that wasn't who the state hated the most. He glanced sympathetically at the minister, who just sighed dejectedly, continuing, "The Queen ordered this personally." Jachs could understand that."

Even the official edict and the normal bureaucratic inanity had gone through without a hitch, and there, standing before him, was his division during the war in mostly-intact format: The Nertrid-Sorid Sralderi-niyrterenol Division "Rrakrliailn", rebranded and Equestrianized into "96rd Infantry-Division "Canterlot", a personal army of his designed to be whatever the Heer, Vhy, VOPS, or whoever, couldn't be.\n\nA governor controlling thousands of soldiers was unusual in Equestria, but in the Changeling Lands, small amounts of military control could be granted to anyone large and important enough to need "special" security forces. Jachs and his role as Minister of Central Equestria fit that bill to the Nth degree, and the 96rd was the obvious candidate because of his past command.\n\nBest of all, under his watchful eye it had been one of the most tolerant divisions. It got citations for being too lenient or kind to locals, but now that the war was over, that kind of behavior was downright desirable. It was like that division had been built for this very job simply because he had led it. Wasn't Chrysalis brilliant!\n\nThe unit was so freshly-reassembled that the speech he gave to explain things was only fifteen minutes long. Then, the various groups fanned out into their various retrainings, some to become Jach's own vanguard military police, some to become normal defenses, and the rest being more specialized. As long as his loyalty wasn't in question, they would make it easy for him to keep things in Canterlot itself running smoothly."

It was the new Royal Guard of Equestria, recreated with a number of Changeling influences. Gone were the primitive Halberds. Now they were carrying genuine stamped-metal Breakers. Their pure gold armor had taken the same route, and was replaced with a design that aimed to syncretize it with the Heer's style, making it a ferocious combination of blacks and golds and slight touches of red. It was an experiment, and while Jachs had liked it, the first receivers had levied many complaints, (to their officers faces no less) but they were able to be convinced otherwise.\n\nWith that squared away and new scourges ordered, the rest of the day had gone smoothly. Now all that was left was their acting Captain, a Pegasus named Second Wind who was finishing his own last test, hence why the first batch of recruits were currently barely in formation and panting like mad.\n\nFrom the squares, that Captain appeared in his all-black dress uniform and walked up to the Major-General. One of the soldiers broke formation to follow him. He was about to give her the dressing-down of a lifetime when a green fire erupted around her, leaving a changeling in her own dress uniform, complete with Civilian Lieutenant's tabs. Alcippe, seemingly unaffected by the long run, joined Second Wind besides Jachs. "He's good!" She said happily.\n\nJachs looked at the tan Pegasus in front of him, and said, "Would you like to talk inside about your new job? If so, now's the time to dismiss your troops."\n\nSecond Wind smiled lightly before turning and shouting, "All units, dismissed!" and stayed to watch them filter out through the main gates before the trio entered the Castle proper."

Freshly-bathed and dressed in nought but the softest bathrobe known to Changeling science, he prepared to spend those minutes sitting in bed, relaxing.\n\nIt was then that he found a note on his pillow.

Why take the risk that he might not join and instead beef up his security when the sender could do something almost as valuable for their cause with far more certainty by placing a bomb under his bed instead? No, if the sender wasn't stupid (which truthfully was a possibility), then it was a legitimate invitation.\n\nBut would he accept it?

Guess not." The room fell silent except for the other officers searching for evidence and trying to repair that still-alive pony's blood supply.\n\n"Fascinating. Can we go now? We had to call so many officers that the other sixteen guys are just standing around outside wishing they could be in bed like they usually are at this time of night." The officer asked flatly.\n\n"Sure, head home," Jachs answered. It really would have been convenient if his theory had been true, but it was a shot in the dark. Now he had a much more conventional and much more obnoxious task of trying to stem the tide of drugs into the city. It was a crucial job, too, since the Harmonic Resistance was much nicer to fight than any of the groups who would supplement their cash flow with drug selling.\n\n"Death to drug dealers" signs were about to become a lucrative business."

The city was unexpectedly silent at this hour, and in the light of the streetlamp, he couldn't even see Team Meteor, the best soldiers his division ever produced, watching from nearby windows. All he could clearly make out was himself standing alone in the cold... lightly-armed, unarmored, and nervous.\n\nThe purr of a quality (no, luxury) engine reached his ears, but he could see no car down the dead streets surrounding him. When the sound was very nearly on top of him, he shuffled uncomfortably before seeing the interior of a car appear on the road before him. But only the interior - besides the door-shaped look into some sort of limousine's passenger cabin, there was nothing but empty air, or at least that's how it looked to him. The cabin in question was empty, as far as he could see, and he prodded at the backside of the door to it, which was clearly physical, yet the exterior side covered up the interior with a glassy lens through to the world behind it. He looked vaguely in the direction of one of the Team Meteor posts and as conspicuously as possible didn't make the sign for "Start shooting and help me" before getting into the car and disappearing from sight.\n\nWhen he sat down, he found himself in an opulent vehicle. It had interior lighting, the softest cushions he'd ever seen, gold and red velvet trim, and portal-windows on every side with views into a dimension that was as a city-sized art museum, filled with statues and paintings and all other fine and ancient mediums. He felt the car accelerate, causing a double-size replica of The Castle Spice-Alchemists to fall behind along with the bust of Prince Konig. The fact that those were the first things outside the portal-windows was probably why this place was chosen, Jachs thought."

changelings_paxchrysalia.1506.t:0 "The Cornucopia Society"
changelings_paxchrysalia.1506.d:0 ""Where are we going?" Jachs asked. The car hadn't been moving for long, and yet he was already nervous. There was a solid panel separating his cabin from the driver, and whoever was on the other side gave no response. Jachs was already regretting this decision, and the fact that he was alone wasn't helping. At least the car was obeying the speed limit, giving him time to distract himself by looking at the artwork outside, much of which he hadn't seen. Then again, this visual dimension was an art collection.\n\nAfter some amount of time of hoping he hadn't just gotten himself killed, despite the classiness of this organization implying otherwise, the car stopped. The door opened itself again, and after not getting shot in the head by some sort of assailant, Jachs stepped out into an abandoned car park. The door closed behind him, and the car drove away before he could attempt to see the driver. The car park was a large hallway, with trash in the corners and stains from water on the walls. It smelled like a dirty air vent. The only landmark, besides the path behind him, was the steel door to a closet of some sort. \n\nJachs got close and looked into the slit. The other side opened up to reveal two amethyst eyes staring directly into his own. "Governor Jachs," a sultry voice said, "We've been expecting you." The door unlocked and swung upon. He found himself pulled inside of another decadent room, filled with sofas to recline on, and strung-out ponies barely conscious upon them or gathered around tables with vials of glowing blue liquid. Not ponies, unicorns. There was a dubious fog coating the ceiling that swirled and writhed, emanating from who-knows-where. The door slammed shut behind him, causing him to freeze in place briefly.\n\nHis hostess was a unicorn as well, white with a long and well-maintained purple mane. She wore a masquerade piece that covered up most of her face in feathers and porcelain. He decided to hazard a guess."

changelings_paxchrysalia.2506.d:0 "The hostess stared at him blankly, before ignoring the suggestion entirely. "Welcome, Governor, to the Cornucopia Society. You may call me Gloriosa."\n\n"Pleased to meet you, Gloriosa." Jachs replied. "This doesn't seem like your common drug den. Why are you all unicorns?"\n\n"There's no need to be so so direct, dear. Nobody here is in the military." Gloriosa replied as she wandered into the deeper rooms of the complex, always looking behind to make sure Jachs was still following her. "That's the point. We're unicorns. The crème de la crème of Canterlot, who used to run the entire nation as the Princess's loyal nobility."\n\nJachs suddenly flashed back to dozens of times when erstwhile political theorists had embarrassed themselves before him with some tale of arbitrary superiority. This one seemed to at least be eloquent. "And that means getting high in a parking garage?" He remarked. The unicorns down here, splayed out and giggling or mumbling or moaning, were hardly as noble as a Changeling Queen.\n\n"Don't be so crude, Governor." Gloriosa asked with feigned offense. "Your kind wanted escape, too, when life was grim. Hence the parades, the banners, all that. Still some of you want to escape the machinations of your own mind, which I'm sure you can attest to." He said nothing. "You aren't alone. We were never meant to be ruled by another race, much less another species. So unicorns spend a night or two here, seeing visions of the world as it should be." The masked hostess took an empty seat in the corner, the better to see the addicts. Jachs sat beside her.\n\n"And where do I factor into this?" Jachs asked.\n\n"Always with the questions," Gloriosa dismissed. "Just because you don't have the right eyes doesn't mean you can't just relax and enjoy luxury for a bit." She gestured to the blue vials on their table. "They're on the house. Or you can just take the time to think the normal way about why things are all askew.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.3506.d:0 "He took a moment to look around. All these ponies, of every shape and color. Each taking what time they could to relive the past to dodge the present, in which they were slaves in their own nation, toiling day and night for the benefit of their mortal enemies. Jachs would never wish to relive his own past. He would never feel nostalgia for the hunger pangs, the worry that some minor illness would end him or one of his loved ones, the indignity of denying his parents a proper burial so that his siblings could get even one extra meal, the parade of his fellow's corpses he saw as he made his way across Equestria, the endless letters that some niece or nephew or friend or brother had been bayonetted, disintegrated, perforated, eviscerated, died screaming and bleeding after being maimed by one of these furred THINGS. He wished like nothing that he could take pleasure from these damnable creatures suffering as he had suffered, but all he was left with was a cold desire to see them all cast into a pit of fire so that he could hear them cry out in pain himself, and then never have to think about them again.\n\nBut it wouldn't accomplish anything, as he had learned from experience. So he buried the feeling once more. He wasn't at all surprised that, in the distance, he saw a familiar white unicorn with a grey mane, tired and unkempt, nearly catatonic on another set of cushions.\n\n"I understand." He said flatly, relaxing his muscles from their tensed-up state.\n\n"I knew you would." Gloriosa purred, and lifted a vial. "But you want to hear what I can offer you, I can tell. This concoction is love, concentrated love, refined in ways your kind has never dreamed of. Try some, and this can be the start of us both fixing our worlds."\n\nJachs looked grimly at her. "And if I refuse, and hunt you and your addicts to the end of the world, you will fight back until the bitter end, I'm guessing."\n\nShe smiled. "Would you have it any other way?""

He hesitated, not having any idea what he would find. Would he ever regret missing out on that part of officer school again? He thought not. Gloriosa lifted another vial in hers, unscrewed the cap, and downed it all at once. Jachs followed suit, in spite of the sickeningly sweet taste, and an equally overpowering confectionery stench. Seconds passed. "You've made the right choice, Governor," Gloriosa said as his vision began to blur.\n\n"What can I expect?"\n\n"We've never given this to a changeling before."\n\nA purple haze crept into his vision, flooding his compound eyes slowly. As it overwhelmed him, he could make out bright lines of deep purple coursing through his limbs, his body, his face, eventually feeling it over his whole body. In Gloriosa he saw the same, as bright red lines traced her blood vessels in his vision. Then, the world simply was an overpowering haze of magenta and violet."

changelings_paxchrysalia.5506.d:0 "As soon as the cloud of raw color dissipated, he found himself in the streets of Canterlot once more. It was a sunny day out, and he was wearing no uniform. Across the street was a small group of ponies walking about. He remembered, as if it had happened, that a few years ago the Changeling Lands had demanded a very conditional servitude of the Equestrian state, and the Princesses, not wanting to suffer the war brought on by the massive Changeling army, accepted. Now, there was peace in both nations, as the changelings did only what they were allowed to under threat of execution by the Queen and the ponies were left mostly in charge of their homeland.\n\nJachs smiled. There was no war, and yet the days of hunger were over.\n\nHe turned across the table to his brother, Jantra. He rarely saw Jantra outside of his Vhy uniform, but here he was. Jachs remembered that, with the cooling of relations, he had gone the same way, and the two could now be on friendly terms again. In the distance, he heard a changeling (one of his cousins who had died in the war) giving his compliments to the owner of the restaurant.\n\n"So how's retirement, war hero?" Jantra joked. Jachs had left the army once it started shrinking to collect his pension. He never saw a single battle.\n\n"It's great. I get to live here, learning the customs and handling the integration. It's rewarding enough that I think I would've come here and done it for free." He breathed the fresh, unpolluted air. There was no hint of industrial encroachment or the suppressed malice of his own Canterlot.\n\nHis brother replied with a chuckle, "Are you really thinking of going native?"\n\n"No, I just like the peacefulness of here. But ponies do love to tolerate, so raising kids wouldn't be too bad..." He thought out loud. He had a house here, it was in a good location...\n\nEven if for just an hour, a minute, a second, or however long it was, Jachs felt happy. In the back of his mind, he wished he would never leave."
changelings_paxchrysalia.5506.a:0 "Oh, for what could have been..."

changelings_paxchrysalia.6506.t:0 "Hangover"
changelings_paxchrysalia.6506.d:0 "Jachs's eyes opened slowly. His head hurt, and there was a noise that kept him from being able to think a complete sentence. The world was blurry, and he barely held his balance as he stood up. At least the fog inside of him was vanishing quickly enough that he could feel it. He regretted to leave his rest until he figured out that he had been buried in a dumpster.\n\nIn front of him was a telephone booth that he recognized. Shaking off the trash as he went, he shuffled inside and propped himself against the wall as he picked up the phone. He was somewhat conscious that it ringing was what had woken him up. "Lieutenant Alcippe?" He asked groggily.\n\n"Yes!" Bellowed the voice of his erstwhile assistant, or what sounded like it. "Jachs, what the hell is going on? You left me a weird note, and you snuck out of your house and we couldn't find you, and now it's early in the morning and you're in uptown and we don't know ANYTHING about what you've been doing!" Good, he thought, Team Meteor hadn't said a word.\n\n"Give me a bit. I need to clean up, and I'll swing by the office and tell you what happened." He claimed. He already had a story involving a late-night rush to help out an old friend, the likes of which had sensitive details he wouldn't talk about, just that it could have gone badly, and it didn't. He did have concerns about slurring his way through it if this after-effect didn't go away fast enough.\n\n"Damnit, Jachs, you can't do this kind of thing anymore, alright? We were worried sick for you. Major-General, I can't do your job!" The voice pleaded over the speaker. \n\n"And here I thought it was because you liked me as a person." Jachs joked back. The silence on the other side of the line was overpowering both the drugged haze and his lingering tinnitus. He bit his tongue and continued, "Right. I'm sorry for making you worry, Alcippe, but sometimes you just have to do what you have to do.""

Go find someone else to peddle your mush to."\n\nAs he stood up to leave, Gloriosa replied with a hint of humor, "And after we've been so nice to you. Well, it seems that you can lead a bug to culture but you can't make them think." He could hear her reaching for a weapon from under the table.\n\n"Oh, I understand the favor." He stated as he walked away. "That's why I'll find it in my heart to spend the rest of the night sleeping before I tell the guys in grey about this operation of yours. But really, I simply can't allow this kind of business to happen in my city, I'm sure you understand." The masked unicorn laughed to herself as he passed through the piles of barely-alive unicorns that coated the floor.\n\nIn a short while, he was above-ground again in the cool, empty night air. It was a real shame, but a group like that was too dangerous. Bringing someone else's secret society into your own fold would be a recipe for political disaster. Besides, every changeling knew that drugs were for Thoraxians and other smelly unfortunates. Now if only he had a way to get a team of assault cops together at this hour... Oh well, at least he was being kept honest.\n\nThe next morning, as promised, he oversaw an operation to raid a place he had seen a lot of suspicious activity around during a late-night walk. Besides a few pieces of detritus, leftover furniture and empty vials and the like, there was nothing there. But the organization did get an interesting look into a certain group called the Cornucopia Society, enough for their intelligence officers to sink their teeth into."

"I am told that you have been bypassing procedure to add a number of ponies into your organization's upper ranks. Unicorns, to be precise."\n\n"I have it on good authority that they're capable workers." Jachs responded sternly.\n\n"I know what you're doing, Major-General, and it's a dire charge I have. You do not know who you are dealing with." Dieter insisted.\n\nJachs didn't have to take this. "Dieter, your Undercaptain Carnara is very worried about you. No one would think less of you for going to any of the state-organized anti-addiction facilities. I'd recommend you take advantage of that. I've seen what you put in your body." Jachs insisted back.\n\nDieter paused. Then he said with a hint of pleading, "Jachs, that stuff is the only way I can sleep at night without nightmares."\n\nJachs sat in his chair and turned to his paperwork. "That's fine, but I don't want to hear about what I should and shouldn't do about that group when you are working with them for less worthwhile reasons than me. I won't try and step on your wings on that, and you won't step on mine about this. Right?"\n\nDieter said nothing. He just turned the thought over, nodded, and went to leave the room. Jachs called out to him, though. "Is your ideal world really just a good night's rest?"\n\nDieter explained, "No. It's done that ever since the first time, when it gave me a vision of being shot in the head."\n\n"I see," Jachs said."

In front of him was the streetlamp-lit form of an E.R.A. surplus truck, now popular among the lower classes because of how many wound up on the market after the war.\n\nThe owner was one Octavia Melody, a renowned cellist who Jachs was ordered to hire for the upcoming dual coronation of Queen Chrysalis. "I thought it was a joke," Octavia replied, jumping out of the bed sans instrument case. "The government doesn't exactly like me. Something to do with making my opinions known on the slavery, the police state, the exploitation, et cetera. So what are you trying to hire me for?"\n\n"There's a major event coming up at the Canterlot Castle. It's a ways off, but I want to secure the best cellist in Equestria as a surprise." Jachs lied. "What are your prices for this sort of work? I am willing to pay a rather large sum... or maybe you don't want money."\n\nOctavia thought, and thought, and thought, and then smirked. "My price is the release of the Friendship and Harmony Forever Ensemble"\n\nJachs raised an eyebrow. "Really? The ones who got jailed for interrupting Queen Helvia's birthday? Well, there are easier ways to say that I should look elsewhere."\n\nThe cellist leaned back. "Oh, you're going to do it. Because ever since 1002, I've been remembering that I was slated to play at Princess Cadence's wedding, and I was struck by how that same Princess showed up to every single practice I did no matter what. Since that wasn't Cadence, I'm guessing that Chrysalis called for me by name. So yes, you will do as I say."\n\nJach's raised eyebrow lowered into a scowl. "Okay. Have a nice evening." He turned and walked away, around the corner of the rural bar she had been playing at. When the cellist didn't follow him, he ashamedly walked back.\n\n'Just as I thought, Governor.

The beach wind blew the granules of sulphur into the roiling water, and Queen Helvia and the audience took a moment to sit in silence. After all, they were threatening to boil an entire ocean if it didn't cooperate. They couldn't be seen looking anything less than serious. Then, once the last of the fine powder blew off the pier, it was over, and the crowd began to disperse. The nation was, for another year, protected from freak storms or rogue waves, come to send unfortunate sailors to an inglorious burial, or to wash over the city bearing naught but inarticulate destruction.\n\nJachs was one of the spectators in a hurry to leave. Vanhoover's salty air and numerous canals always made him uncomfortable, but more importantly, he was just plain busy. Appearing at these was part of his job, but it wasn't work.\n\nHelvia met him along the path to the car that would take him back to an office. "Was everything as it should be, Queen?" He asked.\n\n"Indeed. It was a good birthday present that this went off without any rogue bards interrupting like last time." Helvia replied dismissively. Jachs tried to hide his bracing for impact. "Funny thing, their behavior would have had them shot that same day if they were changelings in Ditrysium. But you argued that I should spare them, and they received life imprisonment instead. Recently, I heard that even that was apparently too dramatic for you, and their sentence was commuted after not a full year. Would you care to explain that?"\n\n"It was the cost of the services of a very valuable non-government contractor, I'll have you know." Jachs said.\n\n"Are you out of money?"

It was an important thing since he had to make sure that the workers weren't distracted by the massive screaming protest mob being barely held back by dozens of Second Wind's new Royal Guard. An explosion screamed the death knell of an outwork, soon to be replaced with a concrete fortification, as was the entirety of the outermost layer of the structure.\n\nYes, much of the School for Gifted Unicorns was being destroyed, and it was predictably unpopular. Jachs had never seen such a large protest, although he had seen plenty of riots. With the amount of bricks nearby, the line was currently easy to cross.\n\nThe reason for this was that the colossal collection of Arcana which the School had, and that it included a lot of objects which were basically immovable. Naturally, the labcoats said those were the best parts. So it was either tear up a piece of priceless Equestrian heritage, or leave much of the most valuable knowledge out of reach, and the Queen, in her infinite wisdom, chose the former.\n\nJachs had done all he could to ease the obligatory re-opening, but much of the artifacts were part of the curriculum, either as learning aids or as learning tools. The School would likely never reach its former glory again, especially considering the Royal habit of hoarding interesting things in reliquaries forever. The place where some of the greatest mages in history had taught and learned was being consigned to history by his own signature. Sometimes, that was just how his job was.\n\nHe looked over to see Second Wind himself, making sure his troops were in line. One of the protestors had spit in his face, and he was wiping it off. They were all lucky that the construction workers were joking in Changeling."

He'd seen them all, action, adventure, romance, thrillers, political propaganda masquerading as movies, movies masquerading as political propaganda... and yet, once again, he could hardly bring himself to enter. Unfortunately, he had a job to do.\n\n"Hey, C!" The ticketer said as the critic walked to the booth. It had once been enclosed glass, but now it had an extra layer of bars simply because it reminded the new clientele of home. The ornate glass doors had been replaced with metal slabs for the same reason. "What movie you watching today?"\n\n"Are any of them good?" The critic asked. He checked the printed schedule and all the names were badly-translated changeling; Love Rockets, Von Napalm Burns the Traitors Again, Captain King... "My employers want me to see another 'tragedy' film, like the ones which look exactly like the comedies, but I need a break."\n\nThe ticketer tapped his hoof to the desk. "Well, I have just the thing. For some reason, we've got to have a load of showings of Springtime For Chrysalis. One's starting in a few minutes. How about I give you the old Critic Discount and let you slip into that one?"\n\nThe critic's eyes brightened. That film had been a hilariously terrible drama in the guise of a jingoistic exploitation flick. He loved it. "Hell yes."\n\nSoon, he had navigated past the crowds of changelings, the bloodcorn machine, the jerky stand, and the carbonated Benzin to take his seat at screen 3. Finally, a show where he wouldn't be rubbing elbows with jeering bugs. What changeling would see this racial epiphet of a film?\n\nHalf an hour later, after the pre-movie ads, notices, and capital punishment highlight reel, he realized that the changelings sitting besides him had managed to ruin the movie by enjoying it.

Apparently, the stuff I got on me isn't even dangerous if you've taken the right pill.\nSo I'm writing you this letter to say thank you. I know own gratitude. You saved me a lot of pain and trouble, and you've done it for a lot of changelings I know personally. Keep up the good work. I don't know if this letter will reach you, or if some desk-jockey will send it to Tartarus for not coming with a form I-C-T-T in triplicate with a box of donuts and a diet soda, but I have to try.\n\nGood luck, Scaevola.\n\n\nP.S.

Do not give it to any changelings who are suspected of dissidence under any circumstances. Do not trade these materials towards or from other administrative offices who have also recieved it.\nFinally, this is not the only time when such a bonus may be delivered to your office.

He had no idea where there even was a "start" to this design. All he knew was that he had to get it done, because the broadcast authority had moved the bond operas to after midnight and he was tired of his wife waking him up by watching them at such an hour.\n\nIt was under that condition that his mind drifted to a shimmering vial of blue goo. He had been told that it was one of many such vials of ultra-refined love that his company had been given for assistance on a more martial project. Why he had one, he didn't know, but supposedly it would make him much smarter. Naturally, he decided to try it.\n\nThe taste was subpar. After a few seconds of feeling as if his mind was physically expanding to cartoonish proportions, he looked down at the papers in front of him, and still had no clue. He decided to get some water to wash the grossness out of his mouth, stood up, and immediately sat back down, scribbling furiously note after note that even he barely understood.\n\nBy the time the sun rose the next morning, he had been staring at his new design for hours, and although it was the most mechanically perverse thing he'd ever dreamed of, it seemed to pass every mental test he could put it through with room to spare."

They bore slings, arrows, muskets, and pistols, which they fired from the balconies at the rows of cops with their steel shields. Their cry was for freedom, democracy, and the Equestrian way. "Double Square!" The sergeant called out, causing the police to split into two formations with a road down the middle. A Panzer 2-LE used the new avenue to empty its autocannon at the protestors, filling the hall with rage and blood and adding a third digit to the bodycount.\n\nWithin the week, the remains would be picked clean, the arrests made, and there would be no more reporting, just funerals for the dozen-odd officers who died. Food riots such as that were normal now, after all. That is why news of it was not on the ears of the hive's Queen, Argynnis, who was in Vesalipolis with Queen Chrysalis, discussing the imminent negotiations.\n\n"Since when has impossibility been a barrier for me?" Chrysalis asked with the intonation of a joke.\n\n"These are traitors, animals, and worse. Not even a god could make them bow, and you are not a god." Argynnis replied.\n\n"Yet." Chrysalis smirked. Argynnis growled. They entered the throne room of Vesalipolis, a grand panopticon from which the Queen could order hundreds at once. Today, it was only a few dozen, who were arguing loudly. Chrysalis silently clambered over the back of her throne to take her seat while Argynnis walked around to the hollow circular table erected in the room.\n\nChrysalis surveyed her new domain. To her left, a group of officers of the Vhy, her personal enforcers. To her right, a number of monarchs and their higher supporters, who were her higher supporters by military right. Ahead on one side were the Black-Generationists with their rough grey coats and obsolete weapons, and on another the Prandialist-"Marksists"."

"My fellow Changelings, you have been gathered here today because all of us are at a crisis. The Thoraxians are taking our land by storm, and if they win, they will sell every single one of us to Celestia. What I desire is the assistance of you and your followers to crush them, and then their benefactors. What do your groups wish in return? First I shall ask Father..." Ugh. "...Mator, for he is prepared."\n\nMator stood up, although not very high for a royal. Before he could talk, one of the Prandialists tried to complain about the speaking order, but she was leaning back in her chair, and all her comrades laughed when a Vhy officer tipped her onto the floor. Mator eventually said, "We are willing to cooperate. All we ask in return is an end to the persecution, and first claim to the plains of the Crystal Empire..." An excellent start. "...and as this will ruin our relationship with the outside world, we want guarantees, so we also require getting them on your side." He finished, pointing to the Prandialists.\n\nBefore the Prandialists realized they could ruin everything, Chrysalis cried "Bring in the persuader!" Thorax's second-in-command was dragged into the room in chains and dropped on their section of the table. The Prandialists were hungry as everyone else, and they tore into the struggling figure. When it stopped, the group argued amongst themselves before Urbiates orn Marks, the twice-unofficial leader, calmed them all down. He jumped onto the table and declared, "This guy is so fat on love that I'm worried I will get a coronary. And yet his followers starved!

This was expected, but the degree was not. The Changelings have never once had to occupy foreign land in this manner, nor harvest love sustainably. In the past, they have simply stormed in, hauled off as many as they could carry to be drained in the hives and killed the rest. Starting now, we have no clue what we are doing.

However, our state requires love on an unprecedented scale. Learning to collect it will likely be long, messy, and costly to all involved. A separate state could not afford or survive it."

If we do as we promised and grant them the Western lands of Stalliongrad, we can likely coerce them into going there and not coming back - or at least enough of them that it's no longer our problem.\n\nThe Eastern half is still planned to go to the dangerous elements of the Vhy, who will one day be just as much of an issue if left alone."

Although their equipment was often shoddy and obsolete, their willingness to learn about the foreign cultures made them excellent as police.\n\nUnfortunately, with the cessation of hostilities and the reduction in our military, many of them are becoming dangerously close to the locals, while the rest have returned home to spread their ideas freely.\n\nIt is not yet a major issue, but for as long as they are within our country, they will slowly sow dissent and become a weak point.

They have decided to make a deal in exchange for their future cooperation. They will support this coronation and the devolution of power to governors such as yourself - and in exchange, the last event of the first day of the ceremony shall be a spectation of the most prominent foreign prisoners.

And it was also his responsibility to make sure the hundred thousand soldiers moved in for the parades had enough food and lodging, and the same for all the officials and officers and normal tourists, and that there was enough security and the right streets were blocked off, and an uncountable number of other things needed to make one of the biggest celebrations in history.\n\nOf course, for a thousand-year dream of an entire race being realized, it was a good size.\n\nBut those concerns were in the past for him. Now, after a long day of witnessing the fruits of his labor, of witnessing the massive columns of marching soldiers and tanks and the public affirmations of fealty by the remaining noble families of all of the intra-hegemonic cultures and all the other events, he was in the last phase, a nighttime party behind vaguely closed doors aimed squarely at the upper echelons of the new order. It was the reason why Canterlot Castle was so brightly-lit and decorated in all the banners possible. And it was time for Jachs to truly relax and just enjoy what was left of the celebration with his friends and co-workers. Tomorrow it would continue in Vesalipolis, but that wasn't his concern.

The Changelings had never had priests, as every organized religion they knew soon had the gods trying to destroy the entire race, but the Queen had politely demanded that any weddings in Equestria be held in the Equestrian style, and thus priests were needed. Ergo, a Greneclyfian priest, their humble white robes standing out in the crowd, a representative of the only religion left where self-respecting priests would minister changelings.\n\nThe second thing that he noticed was that he was in a room filled with officers and royals and more and not one security guard had searched him since he came from a quick stop at his house.\n\nHe looked around, and found Undercaptain Carnara chatting with a few other Vhy higher-ups. He made his way over through the throng and said, "Hey, I need to talk to Dieter Heinrich! Where is he?"\n\n"Oh, Captain Dieter isn't here." Carnara replied distractedly.\n\n"What, did his amphetamine habit outrun him?" Jachs snarked. That Dieter wouldn't be here would explain the terrible security, but it was insane that he wouldn't show up. Yet the conversation stopped instantly and the group was audibly upset, with half so appalled that their mouths were agape and the other half looking around nervously. "Oh, you have got to be kidding. Listen, someone needs to be handling security. The Queen herself will be here soon, and we've had reports of Prandialists hopping the Severyan border!"\n\n"Listen, Minister, not even they would dare attack here." Carnara said. "Now calm down.""

changelings_greatfeeling.13.d:0 "Jachs was irritable and impatient as he stalked the hall, looking for a specific figure. It was not just that the event was completely insecure, that it didn't need to be, and that it was simple incompetence that had made it so and made it continue to be so. It was also that Jachs knew how to fix it, and didn't like his solution. He didn't have the soldiers to sweep the whole castle, not that he could gather and organize on such short notice. But he knew who did. It was a changeling Undercaptain in his full Vhy uniform, sitting reclined at a table and nursing a cigarette. Jachs sat across from him, causing him to pull his limbs off of the table and sit upright.\n\n"Jachs," he said.\n\n"Jantra," Jachs replied. The two locked eyes, both unblinking and steeling themselves for whatever was to happen next. However, the sooner this was over with, the sooner they didn't have to talk to each other. "We have a problem."\n\n"We."\n\n"Yes, we. The Queen will be here soon, Captain Dieter is out of commission, and in his stead, Undercaptain Carnara has opted to do nothing. The guards are on standby outside, and nobody is getting searched as they enter." Jachs explained.\n\nJantra leaned in. "We do have a problem."\n\n"Yes. How many sets of eyes can you get here to fix it?" Jachs asked.\n\n"Enough. Who needs to be checked?"\n\n"The Castle staff are handled by their own security. Let's call it every changeling you can find." Jachs speculated.\n\nJantra stood up. "This will be disruptive," he said.\n\n"I'll deal with it. You just make sure everyone here is in order." Jachs replied.\n\nJantra nodded, and left to go gather the Lebstandarte Krisalis to live up to their name one more time. Jachs was worried, but if anyone could get this situation under control, his brother would."

changelings_greatfeeling.14.d:0 "Jachs sat, unmoving, slouched over the table. Was there some way he could help Jantra? Make it start sooner, go faster, run easier? He was struggling to think of one. He wasn't entirely sure how long he'd been like that, but it couldn't have been more than a few minutes, because someone nudged him and he looked up. It was one of the wait staff, who said in his refined upper Canterlot accent, "Miss Octavia would like to speak to you after this song."\n\nJachs thanked him and took a visit to the far end of the hall, where a stage was erected and an odd band was playing. Its centerpiece was Octavia Melody, the cellist, but there were a great number of renowned musicians. Countess Colatura had her microphone, just as Cantatix had her oil harp, and Concentor had his xenophone. There were nearly a dozen musicians on the stage, and their combined sound was as masterful as it was bizarre to hear. How much broad appeal did a song have when one of the instruments sounded like metal being torn in half and another sounded like rushing water?\n\nIn due time, the song ended. Octavia quickly dashed to the edge of the state where Jachs was watching her. He turned his ear to her, and she said loudly enough that he could hear. "Major-General, I'd like to thank you for doing the right thing. I realize that you didn't need to be so kind, but you were anyways."\n\nJachs waved his hoof dismissively. "It wasn't worth the trouble to do it the hard way. Is that all you wanted to say?"\n\nOctavia hesitated, but eventually continued, "I saw Second Wind watching me. He sat for a few songs before looking profoundly unhappy and leaving. I think he was heading to the upper levels. Think you can talk to him? He seems like a good guy."\n\n"I'll get around to it. He is." Jachs assured her. "Thanks for telling me." Octavia nodded and got back into position for the next song."

changelings_greatfeeling.150.d:0 "The upper levels of Canterlot Castle were, as far as the partygoers were concerned, only known to Jachs's office and the ponies. The building was archetypically equine in every way, and an unfortunate side effect was that it was signposted as if the occupants would instinctually know everything. After asking about who had seen him and finding the rest of the way by assumption and memory, Jachs found his co-worker in one of the guest rooms. He was sitting in the dark, staring out the window at fireworks over the vast plains of the Equestria below. There was a slight film from the city's shield, which had been turned into a curtain to block out the light of the night sky, cursed against changelings as it was.\n\nJachs walked to him, slowly but intentionally not quietly, and sat beside him. "Are you going to be alright?" He asked.\n\n"Eventually." Second Wind replied shakily.\n\n"Do you want to talk about it?"\n\n"Do I need to?"\n\n"It's up to you."\n\nSecond Wind didn't respond for a while. "Did you ever wonder what would have happened if your nation had lost?"\n\nJachs sighed. "I still do."\n\n"I guess I wonder about if we had won, too." Second Wind replied. "But we lost. And... listen, I don't blame you or your people for anything, you did what you had to and you're doing about the best for us I could ask for. But the country I knew, that I grew up in and thought me and my children would die in, it's going away. And I'm helping kill it. And that doesn't feel good, even though I can't think of any better way of going about things." He took a moment to breathe. "You get it, right?"\n\nJachs thought for a second. "Yeah, I get it. I'd probably feel the same way in your shoes. I don't know how much it means from me, but I do appreciate the hell out of you for working with us."\n\nSecond Wind chuckled lightly. "Right. Well, I'll be back in one piece by the time I'm needed.""

changelings_greatfeeling.160.d:0 "An hour and a half into the party, a lockdown was called. Soldiers of the Lebstandarte Krisalis prowled the great hall and filtered into the side rooms, ordering everyone they came across to not move while they checked them for weapons one partygoer at a time. After a short while, they soldiers filtered out again, just in time for the coronation.\n\nThe partygoers, the officers, ministers, governors, and other upper/middle government leaders, alongside a battery of decorated war veterans, remaining Equestrian nobility, and important figures from across the continental order, found themselves directed into a grand field of the Castle. The spotlights continued to shine into the sky, the castle walls were lit in every color, and the night air, open yet warm, left many of the homeland-stuck members feeling as if they were in a new world. Jachs and a number of other high officials were besides Queen Chrysalis as she, in an elegant dress laid with innumerable gemstones and woven from spider's silk, prepared to accept a crown made of jade ornaments placed atop a golden ridge.\n\nJust as she was to take it and place it upon her own head, a burst of distant automatic gunfire rang out. Jachs recognized it as an MG-00, and from the length it went on for, he guessed that the user had held the trigger down for an entire 50-round drum. There was murmuring, the guards were alert and looking around, and a single rifle shot rang out from the roof of the Castle, followed by the sound of something hitting the ground from a great height. Jachs looked around furiously and found Jantra, who was already flying across the field towards the sound of the disturbance.\n\nAs Jachs sat concernedly with the rest of the important figures, Queen Chrysalis stepped up to the microphone, and said, "Excuse me. Our security has it handled." The changelings promptly sat back down and resumed a reverent silence. The ponies saw, and nervously followed suit. Chrysalis placed the crown upon her head."

She put it out and they all piled around a table, laying down their bags and pulling out shortened rifles and repossessed submachine guns. "This is the security we've seen," She began. "They've got things battened down tight, but it's sloppy. They weren't even checking folks at the door until someone got half the extra security involved. Here's the schedule, and here's a map of where the coronation is going to be. What's your plan?"\n\nRainbow Dash explained. "At the end of the coronation speech, there will be one last volley of fireworks, the biggest one yet. We'll head to the roof of the building in a few minutes and get ready to fly over. With all the sparklers and streamers, a few more dark spots won't stand out, but the target will be bright as day." She had to speak up, as their driver hadn't turned his engine off and was waiting outside. "Then we drop our surprise, and get out."\n\n"That makes sense, but we'll have to go over where the danger zones are. Those spotlights aren't just for grandeur, they'll still catch you." The informant replied. "The map has those marked out as best as we could."\n\nRainbow Dash pulled her team in. They began to intently memorize the layout of the town, where the security was, where the problem areas were and what landmarks to watch. She could barely keep on the subject. Her pulse was racing. She hadn't been this excited for a mission... ever. "We ready?" She asked. Everyone else nodded. They looked up, and saw the worst-case scenario. In their concentration, they hadn't heard the plodding footsteps or seen the figure turn the corner, and now they were staring down a lone panzersoldier, levelling an MG-00 in its magic.\n\nRainbow watched her squad try and grab guns before the room filled with fire and blood, but they were worthless against the armored shell before them. She had only one thought."

changelings_greatfeeling.180.t:0 "Two Surprises"
changelings_greatfeeling.180.d:0 "No more gunfire came afterwards. Chrysalis, as she launched into her coronation speech, was nearly uninterrupted. She talked at length about who she, and the nation at large, had to thank for the glories that now sat upon them. Of the royal class, who had all aligned to rally under her banner. Of the paramilitaries, from hive militias to the Vhy and the Black Generation, who set aside their differences for the good of the race. Of the collaborators, who had taken a great risk but had done an immeasurable service for the changeling race and could now begin to have it paid back properly. And most of all, of the heroism of every soldier of every kind, whether their part in the fight was violent or mundane, before or during or after the war, without whom the race was nothing. It was these who Queen Chrysalis thanked as she officially took the title of Empress of Equus, a title which hadn't even been coveted by any changeling because it was fit only for a god and the race had none.\n\nThere was, however, one more interruption. In the concluding stage of the speech, Jantra and a few guards brought a lone panzersoldier to the front of the crowd of spectators, who was panting from the exertion of walking here in full getup. They stood in the center of the main aisle silently, but when Chrysalis turned to them to hear what they had to say, Jantra spoke up. "My Empress, this soldier has foiled a dangerous plot against your life! Not only that, but she has killed Rainbow Dash and five other high profile rebels! We even got their spotter!"\n\n"What wonderful news!" Chrysalis shouted. "Soldier, you have not only saved me, but made our nation's brightest day even brighter by delivering us one of our greatest enemies. For this great service, I will grant you a single wish."\n\nThe panzersoldier's horn lit up, and they untied the laces of their headwear. A respirator/helmet combination floated in front of her, a red unicorn with golden eyes and a cropped mane."

Many had heard that Jachs was bringing ponies into his ranks in unprecedented numbers, but to see it in its most dramatic form left the audience in perfect silence.\n\nThe soldier herself was silent as well. With the scale of reality, and no longer needing to breathe through a filter, she got her panting under control and stood still. It was only a few seconds, but Jachs could see how shocked everyone was about this turn of events.\n\nThe soldier was mesmerized by the sole attention of someone that even she recognized as one of the most legendary of the era's living legends. Yet she knew what she wanted. "I... I have heard a rumor that you plan to have dozens of our national heroes killed later tonight. Is it true?"\n\nChrysalis looked to the other royals, who said nothing but attempted to rend her soul in half with their glares. She turned back and replied, "Yes, it is true."\n\n"C... could you not do that?" The soldier was nervous and yet forged ahead regardless. Exactly as she was trained to, Jachs thought with annoyance.\n\nChrysalis was faced with uncertainty of her own. She could break a promise made in public or she could break a promise to her most significant backers. The option she picked was to concede. "Then it shall not happen." The soldier breathed a sigh of relief, while the royals nearly ground down their teeth in response. Just as Chrysalis herself felt relief at the decision being behind her, there was yet another loud boom, and all eyes turned to see the first of the fireworks that were supposed to mark the end of the speech. It was poetic in a way which would have been a unique sort of awful to those who could cause the greatest problems.\n\nFor his part, Jachs didn't know what to feel."

changelings_greatfeeling.200.t:0 "Cleanup"
changelings_greatfeeling.200.d:0 "The weeks since the coronation had been interesting. The switch from Queen to Empress had many routines upset, but the new Empress was understanding. Equestria was as quiet as it had ever been, but the spectacle at the Canterlot event was going a ways towards lasting peace. The problem was close to home - or work, in Jach's case. Empress Chrysalis no longer had the support of the royals. They believed that, in their time of triumph, she had sold out their nation's values to curry favor with their enemies-turned-subjects. Now, any substantial order that left Vesalipolis but not the core territories was bound to wind up a disaster.\n\nThere was more. Dieter, now recovered from his medical emergency, placed one of the rebel weapons from the coronation night on the table. "We have a problem." Dieter began. "Anyone want to guess what it is?"\n\n"Someone's trying to kill the Empress?" Someone suggested.\n\n"Worse." Dieter answered. "Anyone else?"\n\nJachs took a turn. "I had no idea these things were even built. I'm pretty sure they were never deployed, and thus never had a reason to leave the country. Yet the rebels had them. They have changelings on their side, either multiple or a higher-up, in order to sneak an entire crate of these things out. Probably a the latter, since the former wouldn't have known about these either."\n\n"Exactly right." Dieter said. "At this point, the number of suspects is too large, and we would only figure out who it is if we got lucky. We also do not know what the perpetrator's reasoning is. Basic analysis says they're either pro-Equestrian, or anti-Equestrian."\n\n"What the hell does that mean?" Synovial shouted from the back.\n\nJachs stepped in. "It means they're either Thoraxians or some derivation, or they were trying to get Empress Chrysalis replaced and give her replacement a reason to crack down." And no one knew which was true. What a wonderful situation."

changelings_greatfeeling.210.t:0 "Some Time Ago..."
changelings_greatfeeling.210.d:0 ""Places, changelings, places!" Jachs shouted through the megaphone. He was slightly giddy. Here he was, sitting in the high chair, barking orders across the mocked-up cherry farm set, making sure everything was in place. Even if it was just the one shot, he was a director. A director! So many brilliant films had made an impact on him over the years, and he was going to be placed in that illustrious history! "Alright, Pupa, your character!" He continued, and one of the actresses shapeshifted into an earth pony by the name of Jumper Junebug. "Okay, that's good. Good! Everyling, let's make this the last take, okay? Lights, camera, action!"\n\nThe actors and other stage folks took their places and started going through the scene. It was the dramatic crescendo of the movie, with the pony farmer and her soldier husband pretending to like each other more than they ever really had in a pathetic attempt to mask their suspicions. They would only distrust each other more over the course of the evening, until they mortally-wound each other, and on the carpeted living room floor, he discovers that she was not part of a resistance plot to kill him, and she discovers that he was not trying to inherit her property.\n\nEven sitting where he was, Jachs felt bad. The movie was in Equestrian because Junebug wouldn't have been able to speak Changeling, but no pony would ever have gotten the joke. It was for the better, truthfully - when ponies made comedies for Changelings, it was unbearable.\n\nThe scene ended. "And cut! That'll do perfectly, we'll fill in the voice over in post. Great work, everyling! Great work!" He turned to an old friend of his, the actual director, who had gotten him onto this set. "Man, I need a high chair for my office. This is awesome."\n\nJachs heard someone speak in Griffonian. He turned to look and for the briefest moment he thought he saw himself standing off to the side. But then, nothing. He put it out of his mind swiftly and continued."

He had had a vague notion of what he had agreed to, but once he had found a phone and gave the order, it suddenly set in. He had just disobeyed an extremely direct order from Queen Chrysalis herself. He, a Minister of the Queen herself, had just directly disobeyed the Queen personally.\n\nHe was going to be killed for insubordination for sure.\n\nHe was trying to think of how he was going to explain himself. Well, he was TRYING to stop panicking so that he could get to thinking of an excuse. Overwhelmingly, though, what was going through his head was "I am going to die, this is the worst decision I have ever made, what is wrong with me, why am I such a coward."\n\nSomeone knocked on his skull. "Hey, you still there?"\n\nJachs jumped partially out of it. The changeling in front of him was familiar. He could have sworn he recognized those yellow eyes, but he just didn't. "Sorry. Who are you?"\n\n"Oh, that doesn't matter, I was just making sure you were still in one piece." The changeling responded. The last part of the sentence was nearly cut off as a bag was placed over Jach's head and he felt himself being dragged away. The panic returned to the forefront of his mind for a brief few seconds before he felt something hitting him, and then he felt nothing at all.\n\n\n\nVaspier watched as the door to the library shut. It was good they'd found him here, that room had a fairly discrete window. He struck a match and mimed lighting a cigarette, and saw in the fire that the wind once again shifted in the opulent hallway. Queen Chrysalis had come up behind him nearly silently. "Hello, My Empress. What can I do for you today?"\n\n"Where is Jachs?" She asked with a deadly seriousness.\n\n"Wish I knew. I heard he was around here, but no luck so far."\n\nShe stared down at him."

The VOPS had a number of such places, but he had hoped that, if it came to it, they would send him to a real facility. He hadn't considered that, though, as he was mostly trying to keep from screaming in terror ever since he woke up.\n\nA bright light shone into his eyes. All he could make out was a faint yellow glow just beyond, and the steel table in front of him. He was restrained to the chair he was sitting in. "Listen, one of my employees threatened to quit and flee the country if it went through, and I realized that the decision was too much and it would undo all the progress we've made in getting acceptance from the ponies, and if that happened, we would get another war, and that's really bad, so I had to stop it." He hurriedly stammered out.\n\nThe yellow-eyed changeling from earlier cocked his head. "Oh, no, this isn't about that. Not directly, at least."\n\nJachs could feel the fear trying to get out. "So what is it about?"\n\n"We are asking the questions here, Major-General." Even though the glare, Jachs could see him adopt a dead smile. "Now, we're just checking a story, so we already know what we want to hear."\n\n"Am I in trouble?" Jachs mumbled.\n\n"Remember when I said we were asking the questions here? Tell the truth and we'll decide how much trouble you're in." The figure growled. "Now, after the parade, and before the Canterlot party, what were you doing?"\n\nJachs slumped as far as he could into his chair before the chains started digging in. The VOPS hated doing things quickly. They liked to watch you suffocate and flail around in the hopes it would convince you to take the shortest route and just admit to whatever you'd done. Torn between a desire to put off the inevitable and a desire to get it over with, Jachs dragged out his words as he answered every question truthfully."

I suppose you're wondering why we had to drag you out here."\n\n"I disobeyed a direct order from the Queen." Jachs said, defeated.\n\n"Yes, and it's a good thing, too. You didn't realize it, but it seems you foiled a plot on the Queen's life." Jachs looked up, slack-jawed. "After you told Second Wind that the spectation wasn't going to happen, he decided to visit your brother. Turns out he was wearing a bomb, and not a small one, either."\n\n"He... he WHAT?" Jachs shouted.\n\n"It's true! We have him upstairs. Turns out he got that rumor from a reputable source, and was prepared to kill himself to try and take Que- Empress Chrysalis with him."

You might wind up being hailed a hero for this."\n\nJachs felt as if he had had a long day, and then instead of sleeping, had a second and even longer day. He was glad it was nearing some sort of resolution. "Can I talk to him?" He asked.\n\nThere was a clicking noise and all of Jach's chains fell off. "Why, we have him here specifically so that you can." He stood up, and Jachs dragged himself to follow out of the (unlocked) room. They went up the stairs, across the hall, and into a dining room, where they found Second Wind sitting alone besides for his two armed guards. Jachs realized he recognized the house, but when he turned to mention it, the yellow-eyed changeling was gone. Instead, he sat next to the pegasus, who was now out of uniform entirely. The two stared out at the Canterlot night, glowing with spotlights and fireworks so that the room was bright despite the lights being off. "

Second Wind answered.\n\n"What the hell were you thinking?" Jachs tried to demand.\n\n"Ah, ponies being ponies. I heard about what was going to happen, and I saw what you were doing and thought it might be true, and I got sucked into it and thought I had to do something about it. Next thing you know, there I am, carrying enough explosives to kill a tank, and I've just realized I don't actually know if what I heard was true. But it's too late to go back now, and there you are, and you tell me it's all a lie." He looked sadly. "And just like that, I realize that I've let myself be somepony's puppet again just because they brought up Equestria."\n\nTime passed. Distant fireworks punctuated the moments. "What do you think will happen?" Jachs asked.\n\n"Don't know. I'll probably be shot. Already have all my affairs in order, at least. And hey, at least I'm dying my own man, instead of being a meat-shield." He sighed with resignation. "Don't suppose you could help with that?"\n\n"I'm afraid not. The Empress will be mad at me for cancelling the mass execution as soon as you were out of sight." Jachs explained.\n\nSecond Wind chuckled. "What the hell were either of us thinking?"\n\n"I don't know, Captain." Jachs stood and walked away. He was tired.

The audience was all in order as far as she could tell, there were no anomalous explosions, nothing. What a tragedy. She turned to her companion, a regular of her business who she had found wandering the upper district, a poorly-kempt all-white unicorn. She planned to drop him off at a hospital. He was shivering and unresponsive and muttering to himself in Griffonian, which didn't surprise her since he spoke with that accent.\n\n"It seems my message didn't make it," she said idly. "Oh well, there's always next time." The unicorn muttered a bit. "Oh, I'm not one for sportsponyship. All is, in love and war, fair. Or so the saying goes."\n\n"Wer... werfer... flammenwerfer..." The white unicorn mumbled. Then he shouted, "Flammenwefer!"\n\nThe purple-maned unicorn turned in surprise just in time for her patron to wrestle her to the ground, placing his hooves on her throat and put all his weight onto them. "Du hast meinen freund getötet, du roter untermensch!" He screamed with murder in his eyes.\n\n"Get off me, I can't breathe!" She screamed back, but he was unstoppable. She tried to hit him in the head, to kick him off, to shove away his hooves, but he was far stronger and far heavier than he looked. She kept fighting, even as her vision was overtaken by brilliant colors and as then the colors merged into a big black mass. She stopped fighting after that, as her limbs fell dead and her head rolled back.\n\nThe white unicorn sat on her, panting but no longer screaming.\n\nHe stood up and dully walked out of the car and into the open night air, "Alle sind tot, alles ist tot..." he mumbled to himself on repeat as he shuffled aimlessly into the night."

changelings_greatfeeling.211.d:0 "Empress Chrysalis sat upon her throne in the Canterlot Castle. Arrayed before her was everyone involved with the security during her coronation, and with that damn ungrateful pony who had tried to do her in. Disaster was nearly averted, and it was time for justice to be served. She had a feeling she knew which way the wind would blow.\n\n"That is why I believe that, having seen our government's willingness to meet with the ponies halfway, Captain Second Wind will not cause any problems again barring a large-scale shift in the policy away from the ponies' 'common decency'." Jachs finished.\n\nVaspier went next. "Everything we've been able to turn up says about as much. Frankly, I think he'd make a great early warning sign for in case we're going too far again."\n\nAlcippe agreed. Finicus cited lack of knowledge, but Marsilio gave an impassioned speech on the need for second chances until Chrysalis cut him short. All in all, not a great start for justice. Luckily, Dieter was next, and he had recovered from his medical emergency and read up on everything. He explained, "The knowledge that we have been freely given by the pony has been invaluable in getting the drop on a major resistance cell. We've captured a large amount of documents and made great headway. It's absurd that we must have a pony in a prominent role in our government, but if that is how it will be, then this isn't much better than any other time to fix that."\n\nChryalis thought she was going mad. Even Dieter supported clemency? She turned to the last of those assembled, Queen Argynnis. "Well, what do you think?"\n\nArgynnis proclaimed, "You wanted a perfect coronation, didn't you? You ranted about it for hours. Well, unless you want your coronation to be marred by an assassination attempt, you'll forget about this. I say he can be kept around."\n\n"EVEN YOU?" Chrysalis nearly shouted. Argynnis merely smirked. The Empress rubbed her face. It seemed she had no choice."

On his desk, a phonograph played his favorite album loudly on a loop while he tabulated production outputs. Outside, ponies worked the production line, chained to machines and watched by guards in an attempt to get the theoretical maximum amount of productivity out of them. It wasn't sustainable, but it wasn't supposed to be. He took a sip from his drink.\n\n"The workers are losing steam, sir. We'll need a fresh batch soon." A soldier said after entering the room.\n\n"A fresh batch is coming." Finicus replied. He marked down the time. Fourty-seven hours and ten minutes. The longest they'd ever gotten a batch of slaves to work wasn't much longer, and the result demanded six days of rest. Twenty-four hours was better, with one day and change. The point of best returns was fourteen to sixteen hours of mandated work, but...\n\nThe soldier walked away, and Finicus followed. He had his theory, and believed he was ready to share it. As he walked out the door, he could have sworn he bumped into someone, but when he turned around, there was nothing there. "You alright, sir?" The soldier asked.\n\n"So it seems," Finicus answered as they walked down the stairs.\n\n"Sir, if you don't mind me asking, how's the experiment going?"\n\n"It is going. The data is useful. Now that soldiers are returning, labor is cheap again, slaves continue to be expensive. Specialized workers continue to grow in value, specialized slaves continue to be a threat." Finicus replied. "More extreme work regimens than current are not more productive. All as I predicted."\n\nThe soldier paused. "So... if I've been listening to you correclty, that means that slavery's going away, right?"\n\n"As a source of labor, maybe. As a luxury good: unknown."\n\nThe soldier rubbed his chin.

Towards the back, where the dividing wall between the two was, tables and chairs spilled out across the boundary. The faint sound of music, a hybrid of Changeling and Equestrian instruments, made its way over the rumbling of the crowd.\n\nJachs didn't see anything interesting at first, so he hung back while the group each made for their own interests. He just sat by one of the many food tables, reminiscing on the years of work this whole ceremony represented. He wasn't truly sure how he felt about it. Maybe he never would be. He had been party to all manner of incompetence, cruelty, and other excesses of his own society, yet he knew he would never trade it for life before the war. In the end, he decided to follow his own orders and look for something to entertain himself.\n\nWhat he noticed was that he was in a room filled with officers and royals and more and not one security guard had searched him since he came from a quick stop at his house.\n\nHe looked around, and found Undercaptain Carnara chatting with a few other Vhy higher-ups. He made his way over through the throng and said, "Hey, I need to talk to Dieter Heinrich! Where is he?"\n\n"Oh, Captain Dieter isn't here." Carnara replied distractedly.\n\n"What, did his amphetamine habit outrun him?" Jachs snarked. That Dieter wouldn't be here would explain the terrible security, but it was insane that he wouldn't show up. Yet the conversation stopped instantly and the group was audibly upset, with half so appalled that their mouths were agape and the other half looking around nervously. "Oh, you have got to be kidding. Listen, someone needs to be handling security. The Queen herself will be here soon, and we've had reports of Prandialists hopping the Severyan border!"\n\n"Listen, Minister, not even they would dare attack here." Carnara said. "Now calm down.""

The building was archetypically equine in every way, and an unfortunate side effect was that it was signposted as if the occupants would instinctually know everything. After asking about who had seen him and finding the rest of the way by assumption and memory, Jachs found his co-worker in one of the guest rooms, laying on the bed and reading a book taken from the nightstand. "Hey, you alright?"\n\nSecond Wind kept reading. "Yeah, I just wanted to be alone for a while."\n\n"Alright, just making sure you're fine." Jachs replied before ducking back out.\n\nMidway through, he was stopped. "Actually, I do have something I'd like to ask you." He pulled back inside to see that Second Wind had put the book down and turned towards him. "I've been reading the history of your race. It seemed like it would be useful. I never realized just how much fighting you all do. Hives fight hives, drones fight royals, the species fights the other species, and everyone fights the world. I just can't imagine that kind of life."\n\nJachs shrugged. "'Life' is all it is. You grow up in it, and it's nothing special."\n\n"I guess. I know a lot of the war caught me off guard." He paused. "We didn't have that kind of thing. It got me to wondering - we have cutie marks, practically baking individuality into us. But you? You're all nearly indistinguishable, even to each other. Do you think, if you had marks of your own, your species wouldn't have had such turbulent history?"\n\nJachs growled, "Do you think, if you didn't have marks always reminding you of your individuality, that you would have crushed our species into the dirt before we burned your cities and put your entire race in chains?" Second Wind stared at him, and Jachs realized what he said. "I'm sorry. Bad memories."\n\n"No, I get it." Second Wind replied. "That's all I have." Jachs nodded and left the room."

After a short while, they soldiers filtered out again, just in time for the coronation.\n\nThe partygoers, the officers, ministers, governors, and other upper/middle government leaders, alongside a battery of decorated war veterans, remaining Equestrian nobility, and important figures from across the continental order, found themselves directed into a grand field of the Castle. The spotlights continued to shine into the sky, the castle walls were lit in every color, and the night air, open yet warm, left many of the homeland-stuck members feeling as if they were in a new world. Jachs and a number of other high officials were besides Queen Chrysalis as she, in an elegant dress woven from spider's silk and decorated with slick green strips, prepared to accept a crown made of jade and emeralds.\n\nAs it sat on a pedestal before her, she launched into a grandiose speech about the war. She talked at length about who she, and the nation at large, had to thank for the glories that now sat upon them. Of the royal class, who had all aligned to rally under her banner. Of the paramilitaries, from hive militias to the Vhy and the Black Generation, who set aside their differences for the good of the race. Of the collaborators, who had taken a great risk but had done an immeasurable service for the changeling race and could now begin to have it paid back properly. And most of all, of the heroism of every soldier of every kind, whether their part in the fight was violent or mundane, before or during or after the war, without whom the race was nothing. It was long, but it was long overdue. Towards the end, Jantra sat besides Jachs and whispered, "We found three potential threats, but I don't think they were serious.""

changelings_greatfeeling.172.d:0 ""Two officers forgot to leave their service weapons at home, a third was juggling grenades as a party trick." Jantra continued. Jachs nodded, a weight being lifted from his chest. Better safe than sorry, he thought, and he bet his brother felt similarly.\n\nThe speech ended and the last phase before she took the crown began. Political and military leaders of the occupied regions stepped forwards, one at a time, saluted the Queen, and stepped back. It was nearly all changelings, simply because this high up was nearly all members of the government from the war or earlier. Jachs took his turn to stand besides the soon-to-be Empress, and Jantra took his a while after, in accordance with their ranks. As Jachs thought about it, though, he realized that the importance placed on Canterlot itself meant that Captain Second Wind was making an appearance.\n\nCaptain Second Wind. The ex-E.R.A. officer.\n\n"Hey, your soldiers checked that pony over there, right?" Jachs asked to Jantra, pointing at the pegasus.\n\n"No, you only said to check changelings, and that's what I relayed. Didn't you check him yourself?" Jantra replied, confused.\n\n"No, I figured your guys would."\n\n"Huh." Jantra said, rubbing his chin. As Captain Second Wind stepped up to receive his salute from the Queen, one of the last, Jachs and Jantra bolted straight at them. In immaculate detail, they got to witness as Chrysalis, her hoof stretched out into the air, turned to look at them. Just then, the pegasus leapt and grabbed her arm, and she moved into action. A green field enveloped him, and shortly, he was shunted away and placed into a thick magical bubble. But he hadn't been sent far: the last thing Jachs could make out clearly as he added a shield of his own, as did his brother and an increasing number of guards, was that Second Wind hadn't let go. Chrysalis's limb was inside the shield.\n\nAs the inside of the green bubble was turned into a brilliant flash, Jachs could feel the world die a little."

Pure ringing was not engaging. Now, why was she laying on her back, in the grass, stargazing when she was supposed to be going from Queen to Empress?\n\nOh, right. That pegasus had turned out ungrateful and tried to kill her. With a bomb, too. Great minds think alike, she guessed. Whatever had happened to her wasn't too ironic, though, since she had survived.\n\nQuite remarkably, in fact. It must have been a weak bomb. Her shoulder hurt like hell, but the rest of the arm that had been trapped was seemingly unaffected. So the blast had shoved her and her arm back with some force, but straight back so the arm was still in one piece. It was a dislocation, not a chitin break. That was easy to fix. Frankly, it wasn't even a show-stopping injury. She craned out her head and looked to where her arm was resting, and didn't see it. She looked lower, and lower, and lower, until she was staring at a chunk of green flesh and a growing pool of blood which was sitting where her right shoulder was supposed to be.\n\nHer head fell back onto the grass, and her back grinded angrily with roiling pain. Above her, she could see a wafer-thin and jagged blue wing floating on the wind above her. Through the film, she could see the bright light of a firework exploding into a shower of sparks.  Soon, it was joined by other bursts of colored light."

You might recall, but I was imprisoned until five minutes ago." He asked, starting to pant. "Also, why am I not imprisoned anymore?"\n\nAlcippe realized she'd never told him. "Oh, right! Your brother-"\n\n"He's not my brother." Jachs corrected her.\n\n"Right. Well, the guy who isn't your brother broke into the chamber where they were discussing what to do with you and gave a long-winded off-the-cuff oration, and the gist of it was that you do act like a Thoraxian but have always served the Queen dutifully and therefore it would be wrong to kill you. The Queen was so moved that she had to give in." Alcippe explained hastily.\n\nJachs was stunned. "Wait, he defended me?"\n\n"He did. It shocked everyone. Anyways, since you're out of jail now, you're being called to help them work out their next issue."\n\n"And that is?"\n\n\n\nJachs nearly missed it at first. It was surprisingly shocking to see his Queen, who was decades his senior and ever-present in his life, sitting askew because of a new missing limb, and clearly not happy about it herself. But when he realized what he'd heard, couldn't believe his ears. Had Dieter just proposed a... cutie-mark-based culling project? What the hell?\n\nPonies would be categorized and sorted based on their marks. Those with ones deemed "too dangerous" would be quietly moved to a secret location and disposed of. It was ghastly, nightmarish, and he doubted whether it would even work since cutie marks were often so obscure. He waited his turn to speak, but it never arrived. After Dieter was finished, Chrysalis just turned it over in her head and declared it was to be the doctrine.\n\nJachs turned to Finicus, who he recalled had a similar project once upon a time, but the good Minister looked appalled with more intensity than he had ever shown before."

She has decided that it is against her Word." He continued, producing a piece of paper depicting the exact order by which arson against civilians was banned. "She is not without mercy, however. The Hauptmann is being sent to assist in the upcoming campaign against Stalliongrad, as will the rest of you. She has decided to overlook your crime on one condition." He paused.

Major-General Jachs asked Undercaptain Jantra.\n\n"We have two counts of forgetting to leave the sidearm at home and one count of trying to do party tricks with live grenades. Besides that, nothing." Jantra answered.\n\n"Well, that's about as good as can be hoped for." Jachs offered.\n\n"It is. Well, actually, it would have been better if there hadn't been a check at all because security was working right."\n\nJachs turned to him. "Do you know what the issue is?"\n\n"Undercaptain Carnara is a commander of soldiers. He doesn't have the imagination to do security." Jantra explained.\n\n"Yes, but of all the things I could say about D... Captain Dieter, 'careful' isn't one of them. I would have expected him to have a backup plan in place. I know it's what I was trained to do." Jachs replied.\n\n"He did." Jantra told him. "When Captain Dieter was... 'out of commission', Undercaptain Rosin took over."\n\n"Rosin? Like Captain Rosin of the Severyana Region?" Jachs asked.\n\n"And now you know why it didn't happen here." Jantra answered. News out of Severyana was sparse and often exaggerated. Between that and the fact that no one was allowed to leave the country for any reason, Jachs wasn't even rightfully sure if Rosin was still alive. He hoped he wasn't. Really, he somewhat hoped that all the rumors were so false that, in reality, the entire region was dead. But that was unrealistic and would have involved the loss of many innocent bystanders, hence "somewhat".\n\n"What a mess." Jachs said idly. "Listen, thanks for having your soldiers go over this whole thing. It's really taken a load off my chest, and I bet it has for a lot of others as well."\n\nJantra looked away. "I suppose you did do something I can't complain about for once. You're welcome." That was about as good as Jachs was going to get it, so he walked off at that point. Maybe later things would change."
changelings_greatfeeling.153.a:0 "Maybe our children won't have this."

changelings_greatfeeling.163.t:0 "Highest High"
changelings_greatfeeling.163.d:0 "Jachs was sitting as part of a stepped semicircle, all looking out at the audience. On either side of him were military and civilian leaders, as many as possible. An unfortunate side-effect was that Captain Second Wind was the only non-changeling, being that there were so few high-ranking ponies and that the few which existed often couldn't leave their posts even for this event without the risk of a problem. But this was known weeks in advance, and any creature of any kind who couldn't be spared would receive their commendations at a later date. This was a time of celebration, but it was also the day when old debts began to be repaid.\n\nQueen Chrysalis herself arrived from besides the stage. She was wearing an immaculate dress of striking reds and golds. As a grandiose crown fit for an Empress sat on a pedestal before her, she launched into a grandiose speech about the war. She talked at length about who she, and the nation at large, had to thank for the glories that now sat upon them. Of the royal class, who had all aligned to rally under her banner. Of the paramilitaries, from hive militias to the Vhy and the Black Generation, who set aside their differences for the good of the race. Of the collaborators, who had taken a great risk but had done an immeasurable service for the changeling race and could now begin to have it paid back properly. And most of all, of the heroism of every soldier of every kind, whether their part in the fight was violent or mundane, before or during or after the war, without whom the race was nothing. It was long, but it was long overdue.\n\nBy the end, Jachs had a tear in his eye. It was hard to forget the days before his only concerns were a neutered band of activists playing at rebellion. He'd sacrificed much, and he'd made others sacrifice far more, but sitting on that stage, walking to his Queen and being personally recognized in a ceremony with a salute back, he finally felt like it was worth it."

changelings_greatfeeling.173.t:0 "Home"
changelings_greatfeeling.173.d:0 "Once again, Empress Chrysalis found herself standing in front of a massive crowd of her hive's population and other fans. For poetry's sake, she decided to compare it to the first time she ever stood before her populace, although there were dozens of other comparable times. Obviously, the most striking difference from thirty years ago was the size of the crowd. But shockingly, the next biggest difference was the size of the individuals within it. It wasn't until the next generation that the shortness from juvenile malnutrition would disappear, but even now, the fact that her subjects were no longer somewhat emaciated was clear even from her high position.\n\nColors were also returning to the dress, there no longer being a need to keep the lower classes from being able to wear non-government uniforms, and since it was now affordable. The endless greys now had highlights of red, of green, and of oh-so-much blue. She herself was wearing a dress separate from yesterday's Canterlot celebration, swapping out the reds for her own hive's traditional blue. Her imperial crown was all colors, though. After all, so was her empire.\n\nAnd, most importantly, she had been surrounded by generals last time, but now she was backed by ministers and virtually all other Changeling monarchs. There were few things in Changeling history grander than seeing so many monarchs literally under one banner once again. It hadn't happened since the days of the Yellow Queen, the first changeling, the only other creature besides Chrysalis to defeat Celestia twice.\n\nThe last change wasn't visual. "Not even I rule alone, nor could I have brought about this great empire alone. If we are to be a nation who's heroism never fades, we must reward even the dead. I am today announcing the creation of a memorial to the fallen of the wars for Equus, the grandest war memorial the world will ever have!"\n\nThe crowd erupted into deafening cheers. It was their relatives being memorialized."

changelings_greatfeeling.183.t:0 "Orbis Regina"
changelings_greatfeeling.183.d:0 "Empress Chrysalis stared at a map in her bedroom of the new continental order on Equus. By now, nearly all the land was covered in a layer of grey indicating that her nation held influence over it in some substantial way. It had been a few weeks, but it was still somewhat unreal to her that her nation, her race, owned all of that. When she was born, it seemed at the end, and her hive wasn't even the most powerful within the fractured domain.\n\nNow, any who wished to speak about "backwardness" or "brutality" had better check behind them first.\n\nBut the joy of being the one behind all this, the one who crushed entire pantheons into the dirt and laid low the existing order, was somewhat dulled by her age. It was estimated that she would live to the two hundred or more, and here she was, not even halfway through and already reaching a height not seen since the Yellow Queen herself crawled out from the swamp. Was there anything who could, or would, challenge her ever again like Equestria did? Was death the last frontier for her to conquer?\n\nShe could defeat gods from the horn and defeat them again from the map, but could she live with neither victory nor defeat?\n\nBeneath the map were artifacts, to be placed in her hive's reliquary or used in some way. Among them was a normal book. It was Twilight Sparkle's original journal, which had never ended up being copied. Reading it, she was reminded of when Factrix's scrap-metal machine guns appeared in the Vraks campaign, and the papers described it as "unlimited camaraderie defeated by a few gears and springs". She had no use for it, and had been intending to send it to Jachs, who might see it differently.\n\nBut she did decide on something to do. She had announced the beginning of construction on the memorial to the war. The largest in changeling history (and thus everyone else's) by a large margin, naturally. By now the first blocks were laid. Maybe that book was to ponies what such memorials were to her kind?"
changelings_greatfeeling.183.a:0 "It's worth a shot."

changelings_greatfeeling.193.t:0 "The Dark Field"
changelings_greatfeeling.193.d:0 "In the middle of an open plain, there sat a great concrete slab which stretched as far as the eye could see. Only a few dozen meters away was a crane, lifting granite blocks into pre-made slots one at a time to create a massive grid of black cubes, every one etched with squares spelling out the names of the war dead. As of yet, it wasn't open to the public, due to not being even a tenth complete, but that was enough for Chrysalis, disguised as an obscure relative just near enough to get in on name alone.\n\nChrysalis sat in between two of the blocks. The scale of this place was already getting to her in this state. On one side of the massive rectangle was the scaffolding for a concrete pyramid to sit at the head, a reminder of what was here for the epochs to come. On the other was the horizon. The block before her was so big even for her large royal form, and had so many names scrawled into it, and there were to be hundreds like it. She couldn't speak, she could barely think over the sheer reverence that flowed through her to look upon the names of the dead. VARTAX-VIANA-VESALI VASPIER-VIANA-VESALI VAGRIO-VIANA-VESALI VANRNE-VIANA-VESALI, they went on forever. So many lives, so many unique experiences and characters and husbands and wives and children and parents, all gone forever so that the new empire could exist, so that the next generation could never know hunger, so that the nation could be whole.\n\nChrysalis knew what to do. Over a thousand years ago, Celestia led her armies to save ponykind from a demon of unparalleled terribleness, and then she built her country better so that it would never happen again. Had Chrysalis not done the same thing for her own race? So building an empire that would last a thousand years really was the way forwards, so that her next great opponent was time itself that her guidance should never leave the nation she made.\n\nDid that make her a god?"

changelings_greatfeeling.203.t:0 "Some Time Ago..."
changelings_greatfeeling.203.d:0 "Minister Marsilio looked at the gawking form of his newest assistant, a fresh graduate named Pedipalp. Standing before them was a unicorn with dead eyes and a sawed-off horn. Its legs were chained up, and there was a mechanical switchbox connected to a small battery on its back, which fed the electrodes wired down its legs and into its brain. A soldier pulled a stick on his remote, and the pony turned, its face still expressionless. "Sir, that is the weirdest thing I've ever seen," Pedipalp said.\n\n"Yes, I'm particularly proud of it. It's just a shame that it doesn't have any practical applications." Marsilio responded. The horn was sitting behind him in a strange device, prepared to levitate a houseplant as a demonstration if only someone would place some protein paste into the associated receptacle. "For something astounding, check this out. Mister, would you please take him for a walk?" The soldier chuckled, and directed the cadaver to walk out the front door.\n\nMarsilio found his job much easier now that they knew enough about pony biology that the research subjects didn't need to be, strictly speaking, alive. The walker was still breathing, but totally brain-dead. All around the laboratory were similar cases, mostly elders but really any pony who was no longer clearly alive, locked in cages as they sustained themselves on instinct and limited medical assistance. Most importantly, Marsilio could sleep at night since they could easily be made to not scream at any experiment he tried.\n\n"The sad thing about it is that these ponies produce just as much love as normal ones, but it's not at all filling. They have no life, so their love has no energy. But maybe one day we'll have some way around even that, and then industrial organ farms will be the future of the race!" Marsilio speculated. He was snapped out of it when he thought he saw himself standing a short ways off, watching, but there was no one there. "Now, where were those wings we were measuring?""

It was a series of equations related to changeling magic, some of which she understood, but most were beyond arcane and recognizably theoretical. She looked up at Queen Yaria. "What exactly is this?"\n\n"Calculations, Queen. About diplomacy. I believe I have found us an unusual ally." Yaria replied, clearly proud of herself. "This is about how changeling bodies interface with equine dark magic, or more relevantly, do not. Cross-referencing my works on foreign dark magic with some theorycrafting and I believe I understand the mechanics of... King Sombra!"\n\n"Really?" Chrysalis seemed intrigued. She took a second glance at the math but still didn't get it.\n\n"Yes, and even better, if my calculations are correct, and I've had them checked three times now, then we - our race - should be immune to his mind-control abilities."\n\n"Are you proposing we attack?" Chrysalis asked.\n\n"Better." She smiled. "He predates us by decades. He knows nothing about us firsthand. I propose we try and form an alliance with his nation.""

changelings_greatfeeling.230.d:0 "King Sombra, the Emperor in his third attempt to create his rightful empire, had not been shocked for a very long time. At least, not without spending years convalescing afterwards. But here he was, trying desperately to maintain his regal attitude as the "diplomatic talks" turned out to not only be real, but so did the "changelings" who had requested them. He didn't expect that they were truly another species, and honestly had expected they weren't real at all. Most of all, the thing he didn't expect was for them to be so big. The herald and the guard insects were short and malformed even compared to his own guards, standing at attention in a row on either side of the throne room, but "Queen Yaria" was taller than him by a wide margin, and "Queen Chrysalis" was taller still in her regal whites, although they were all somewhat skinny.\n\nWith a remarkably elegant voice paired with perfect Equestrian, Queen Chrysalis began, naming off her many titles, most of which were meaningless to him, and finished with, "...We have come to you seeking a strategic alliance, as we have reasons to fear Equestrian attack as well."\n\nHe regained his composure. The shock wore off and he remembered who he was. "So before me I have two monarchs of such importance and power? In my own throne room, no less?" Being a new race was no excuse for such sloppiness around a mage of his incredible ability. His eyes glowed a bright green, and he felt his will falling over them. Then it kept going, meeting no resistance and seeing no souls to dominate. The Queens looked unentertained by the sight. His magic fell silent.\n\n"If you're done, we have much to discuss." Queen Chrysalis stated flatly.\n\nThus began a very educational experience of new politics and potential ways to cooperate with another nation."

We probably could have done a little better, but all in all I'm surprised that he was willing to work with anyone. Wonder if he'll regret this one?"\n\nArgynnis assumed that he would. Changelings were like that. As she read the papers, she found herself slightly sad that the full submission she'd hoped for hadn't materialized, but that was a pipe dream and she knew it.

In exchange for cooperation, the new Lunar Empire would give up the borderlands, from Featherfall to Cape Acadia. If they accepted, then the door was opened for more cooperation to come. If they refused, then it would be them next once Equestria was driven into the dirt. There was no way to lose, only a way to win less. It was perfect.

The message made it clear that total control will be negotiable, but for all intents and purposes the terms are that they will be the primary rulers of those lands.\n\nThis is, of course, insulting. It would be an act of shocking desparation to give up neary three million ponies to those monstrosities. And yet they seem to be trying to turn over a new leaf in the visciousness department, if not the sapience department. To make matters worse, we might have to consider their offer.\n\nMost importantly, the channels are so secret and came from a source so disreputable that we can easily pretend we never agreed to this or even received such a message if we decide to take them up on the offer for now."

It continued on for a while describing finer details, but for now, everyone had turned to Queen Chrysalis, who seemed utterly unsurprised by this turn of events. In fact, she was downright proud. As an agreement, it was something to be proud of... if the Lunarists honored their word, which they could easily fail to do. For now, though, this letter of agreement held some power.

It means that now parents can get to burying their children, and brothers can bury the brothers they killed, and that new homes can be found for the orphans without fear of them being bombed.\n\nAnd for us, it means that we need only wait and soon enough Empress Nightmare Moon will do as she promised and draw the borders so that we have the border states and control of the Luna Bay, ironically named after the very goddess now surrendering its inhabitants to us. Luckily for them, we've been toning down on the pillaging and burning.

Should we follow through with that agreement or not? Nobody will blame us for not wanting to give so much over to them, and they wouldn't even if they knew we were breaking an agreement, but many will take serious issue if we do as we promised.\n\nSadly, like any good dilemma, this one has the scales tipped by reality.

It's a devious one, too.\nTheir new plan has been to take advantage of our Harmonic tradition and use it against us. They have been printing leaflets, posters, just about everything, and leaving them in public places. The goal is to spread knowledge of Changeling life and culture in order to make them seem just as alive and normal as ourselves. These propaganda materials do not argue against the war directly, so it took us a while to realize that they were an attack, but we are now finding that they are being used to bolster 'pacifist' activists, and the worst thing is that some of them seem to be operating independently of any Changeling handlers.\nObviously we can't just let them fill the minds of our nation with thoughts of how terrible this war is when we are still fighting it, but what exactly should be done about this?"

Where it is, bringing it down with heavy artillery would also destroy much of the city and its valuable infrastructure, although the populace could be evacuated just before.\nLuckily, we have a solution.

There are two obvious ways. The first is to elevate explicitly Thestral organizations above the common rabble in order to instantly create an ally that cannot afford to abandon us for fear of a return to something worse than the current normal. The second is to reduce the standing in society of every Thestral officially, and allow ponies to take the greatest fruits of the new underclass, bribing them with cheap labor and legal dark spots.\n\nFinally, we could eschew this entirely, although it would be unwise considering that we already have numerous enemies, not least in the borderlands where we have burned down these cities more than anywhere else in Equestria."

Colossal cannons, racks of anti-aircraft batteries... and atop the mast, a mud-green flag with a red star in the center. "Should I sweep the decks?" He asked, leaning over to Chrysalis.\n\n"Not yet. Maybe it means something different where they come from." She replied.\n\nTwo heads peeked over the rails nearest to where the pair were sitting. One was a changeling in a dirt-green uniform, the other was a pony wearing the same. "How about now?"\n\n"Maybe the pony is their servant." Chrysalis suggested. The foreign changeling yelled where they were in Severyanan, and Chrysalis turned to Dieter and said, "Try to leave some officers alive."\n\n"Wenn sie gut gekleidet sind, zielen sie auf die beine!" Dieter shouted, causing two platoons of marines to fly out from their bunkers and rush towards the ship, guns blazing. Sniper fire rang out for when the foreigners tried to get onto the AA guns, and soon the fighting was entirely inside the foreign ship."

changelings_greatfeeling.290.d:0 "The sailor watched the sea rock and rumble beneath the deck of the destroyer he served on. The anemic and small changeling navy left him and his fellow sea-ponies with plenty of time to spend simply watching the waves and enjoying the salty air. The most exciting thing that had even happened was that, last two days ago, his ship found a submarine while patrolling. Neither was in any position to attack, so nothing came of it. It was the easy life, or as easy as army life can be.\n\nThere was a flashing light over the horizon. It looked like a star for a moment, but then it grew, and grew. The heavy machine guns on the destroyer began to fire, but the radar-controlled guns with the radar-controlled shells were the main anti-aircraft armament and they kept firing horribly wide, and if they didn't, the shells exploded randomly. After mere seconds, the object struck the center of the destroyer, throwing the sailor to his back.\n\nHis mind rushed. Was it a missile? Anti-ship rockets with that level of accuracy were still theoretical, how could the bugs have them? He heard the rocket engine, then he realized that he could still hear the rocket engine. Above him, the strange craft, with its forward-swept wings and fuselage covered in serrations, turned in a half-loop and began to fly back the way it came, leaving a trail of airborne debris. But the wreckage was all grey like the ship's hull, and the plane itself was a moody crimson.\n\nAs the sirens blared the call to abandon ship, he could only wonder."

changelings_greatfeeling.290.d:0 "The surviving crew of the ship we stole from the other universe, now known to us as the 'Worker's Revolutionary Ship Tamato', have been telling an interesting story. Where they come from, the continent of Equus is split between Equestria, as ruled by Prince Solaris and Prince Artemis, and their own nation, the revolutionary state of the Equus Proletarian Dictatorship. The two nations are at war, and have been for nearly fifteen years. The Princes have only held out against the rest of the continent and foreign allies by causing an eclipse over the north so that food can only grow in Equestria itself.\n\nMost importantly, we can definitely acquire more ships from this alternate world, although they are likely to stop building ships with the special radar array that we can track once they figure out we're going to keep taking them.\n\nOne of the officers on board the WRS Tamato has offered to switch sides. They seem to have held little attachment to their own world, and seeing no way home and the possibility of advancement, have decided to throw in with this"

changelings_greatfeeling.30.d:0 "The war situation in the Changeling Lands seems to be hopeless, but some still have faith in an ultimate victory. The Vhy has created a film, "Sicarus", depicting the 387-400 siege of the hive of the same name. It follows a soldier who was born in the early days of the siege and dies taking part in the heroic final assault that turns Celestia and her forces away. Although the substantial costs in soldiers and material are an odd choice, the Ministry of Propaganda believes that the morale value of the film makes up for it.\n\nIt does seem to be having the intended effect. It is not lost on the audience that, famously, 90% of those alive at the start of the Siege of Sicarus were dead by the end. However, the real siege was not won by a brazen counterattack, but because Equestria did not have the resources to continue the siege and defend against the 399 Vraksian Invasion."

Hivesmarshal Trimmel seemed much less offput by this as he pondered the unit markers. It was late at night and most of the officer's had gone to bed. Chrysalis looked to one end of the room and saw no one. She also saw no one at the other end.\n\nShe got close to him. "Be honest with me. Is the war lost?"\n\n"Oh, we're screwed. At least, if the enemy doesn't do anything surprising and dumb." Trimmel admitted. "I say now's the time to start thinking about round two. It's what I'm doing, and it's looking exciting."\n\nChrysalis's face scrunched up with worry. "What will happen to us if we do lose?"\n\nHe shrugged. "Who knows? They'll probably want to try and 'rehabilitate' you for public image reasons and make the rest of us survive on happy thoughts and the magic of friendship. Blech." Trimmel groaned with a hyperbolic dismissiveness. "Whatever the case, I doubt we'll ever be allowed to be relevant again as a race or as a nation. Might even be wiped out. But I'll have enough recruits to keep fighting until I die of old age, so I'll make do."\n\nChrysalis chuckled weakly. His passion was making the prospect of her entire life summing to zero surprisingly easy to bear. "Well, I'll try to not get taken alive for you. Although if I hear about you disobeying my orders, consider yourself haunted."\n\nTrimmel laughed. "Don't kid yourself, they'd rather burn down Canterlot themselves than let you out of Tartarus!""

They have also urged ponies to set aside any political or personal differences for the greater good of their fight for independence.\nThe Changeling state has responded by mobilizing its entire military to put the rebellion down "by any means necessary", as well as drawing special attention to the radical elements already within the freedom fighter's coalition in propaganda."

He muttered.\n\nThe figure sat down at a barstool besides the revolutionary. "That didn't stop you," he said. It was Mator, the preacher who had taken the herder class by storm some years back and created a rebel movement of his own. The grey overcoat and the black-powder rifle slung across his back made him cut a nostalgic figure. Urbiates was wearing a uniform he'd stolen off of a Stalliongradian officer who had been helping the Thoraxians, so he couldn't joke too much about it. "I figured that if we're going to be working together, we should get to know each other a bit better. I'm Father Mator, student of the Heavenly Way. Would you like to introduce yourself also?"\n\nUrbiates stared at him. "I'm Urbiates orn Marks. I've never practiced law but I'm still referenced by name in a number of legal texts."\n\nThe empty bar echoed with nothing. "Did you hear about Hivesmarshall Trimmel's military futurization plan? I think that he's making the right call saying that the new age of ground warfare will be defined by massed armored vehicles and elite infantry," Mator suggested.\n\n"Are you high?" Urbiates replied. "Dieter's plan is far better. Equestria is huge. We need a few high-tech units to break their lines, and then a large army to exploit and support the breakthrough everywhere at once, repeat until total victory."\n\nMator chuckled. "Isn't Dieter's plan based on his past experiences where his army lost?"\n\n"We're made of tougher stuff than his old comrades." Urbiates smirked. "Whatever the case, Equestria can beat us in raw numbers everywhere. We need to hit hard, sharp, and fast. A safe long-term strategy means getting buried in bodies three years in."\n\n"Hm. If only this was our job." Mator wondered aloud."

One of the Vhy's field battalions had performed admirably, pinning an entire Equestrian division in place long enough for them to be caught in an encirclement and destroyed. Vhy Undercapitain Carnara, head of the field units and direct subordinate of Dieter Heinrich, had come to a base camp near the front to personally congratulate them, as they had earned.\n\nAs he arrived, twelve changeling soldiers in Vhy uniforms, many grievously injured, stood in front of him. They all threw up their hooves, yelling, "Heil Chrysalis!" to their general. Carnara saluted back to put them at ease before he turned to the base commander and said, "I expected the entire battalion, not whoever was off-duty."\n\n"This is the entire regiment, sir." The commander explained. "Well, there's one more, but he's still unconscious." Carnara stared at him. "They were ordered to attack the Equestrian position until told otherwise. They... did, sir."\n\nCarnara turned it over in his mind before he looked back to the roughshod group. "Hm. My soldiers," he began loudly, "I cannot offer any praise too high that you faithfully carried out the orders you were given knowing that it meant death. You have done a greater deed for your fatherland in one battle than many do in their entire lives. You have made your contribution to the war effort, and let none judge you for it. Shortly, you shall receive your awards."\n\nThe group stood awkwardly. One asked, "Sir, do you mean we're being discharged?" Carnara nodded 'yes'. It was the least he could do. "But sir, I'm still fit for duty!" He continued. Another one chimed in. "Sir, let us go back in!" A third, one of his legs severed at the joint and bloody bandages covering one eye, nearly fell down at Carnara's feet. "Sir, tell the doctors to put me back in action, please!

Built around the former structure of the Vesalipolis Hive — of which the central spire still remains intact, ensconced within the Tower's largest atrium — this monolith of glass and steel dominates the Vesalipolis skyline, towering over the factories, offices, barracks, and apartment blocks of the Changeling capital. Near the very top of the Tower is the throne room of the Great Queen Chrysalis, where she holds court in a chamber able to accommodate hundreds of bodies. With the exception of the Queen's personal quarters located at the Tower's pinnacle, the rest of the Tower is dedicated to hosting the state and government functions of the Queendom and the Hegemony.\n\nThe fortress-like Tower is as much a military installation as it is a royal palace or government headquarters. Interspersed along its sloped sides are anti-aircraft batteries, radar stations, sniper nests, and artillery emplacements. There are two dedicated battalions of Queen's Guard permanently stationed at the Tower, responsible for its security and policing. Finally, in addition to the offices of the Heer, Evevehr, and other constituent components of the Changeling military, the Tower also houses the headquarters of the Vesalipolis Office of Public Safety. While Director Vaspier Orn Kladisium masterminds the operations of the world's most robust and dangerous intelligence agency from his office only a few floors below the throne room, the interrogators and torturer-psychologists of the VOPS work in the shadows, deep within the subterranean depths of the Tower's basement levels.§!"

One of the first Equestrian cities to fall before the advance of the Heer during the Great War, Acornage became the hub for Changeling military transportation and logistics, through which supplies, armaments, and soldiers were directed to whichever section of the front required them most.\n\nThe long-established Changeling presence in the city made it the prime candidate for large-scale settlement by Changeling colonisers after the war. Acornage's former Changeling Quarter soon grew to encompasses much of the entire city, and the pony population was relegated to the suburbs or inner-city ghettoes, where they still make up a majority of the city's total population. The Changeling immigrants now dwelling in the Hive-Colony mostly congregate in its downtown, where several city blocks have been demolished to make way for the construction of a massive Hive built in the style of those anchoring the Changeling metropolises of Vesalipolis, Vraks, and Ditrysium. Outside the city, Changeling settler-colonies proliferate in the countryside, some being wholly new settlements created from scratch, while others, like Alvarium, were established on the sites of Equestrian towns or villages. These peripheral colonies support the main Hive-Colony, providing food, water, resources, and workers. They are much more highly militarized as well, and while Alvarium remains in transition from military occupation into quasi-civilian colonial rule, the peripheral settler-colonies stand as the bastions of Changeling control over the region, ready to mobilize their populations of soldier-settlers to march on Alvarium should the ponies rise up in open dissent.§!"

Though originally pressured by his family to attend university and become a doctor, Jachs enlisted in the army in 996, and participated in the ill-fated attack on Canterlot in 1002 as an Unterfeldwebel, having risen through the ranks in those six short years due to acute military acumen. Jachs' company managed to find fame in the defeat as the regiment that captured the Element Bearers before they could reach the Elements of Harmony, and when the military situation following the Canterlot disaster was reassessed, Jachs found himself placed in the fast track to promotion, and had reached the rank of Oberst by the time the Great War began. \n\nThough present on or near the front lines for the majority of the war, Jachs' moment of greatness did not arrive until he was tasked with capturing Canterlot. With efficient command of the resources at his disposal, Jachs managed to seal off the narrow passes through the mountains around Canterlot, isolating the city from the rest of the Equestrian army, and approaching from all sides with veteran divisions capable of fighting in the treacherous mountains surrounding the capital. Though the campaign was long and bloody, Jachs worked closely with the Luftwaffe to chip away at the Equestrian defenses before using two Jaeger infiltrator companies to outflank and destroy the first line of Equestrian fortifications around the main road leading up the mountain and into the city. Once the road had been opened, the city fell within days. Jachs would be promoted to Generalmajor for this accomplishment, and when the war concluded, was placed in charge of the central Equestrian garrison, operating out of the place of his greatest victory.\n\nThe trials of peace, however, are a completely different beast than the horrors of war. Generalmajor Jachs has more familiarity with ponies than most of the changelings under his command, and as such sympathizes with their plight. But with the changelings' hold on the city tenuous at best, a firm hoof may be needed to maintain it. The Generalmajor now faces a true test of his morals: can he hold Canterlot without resorting to wanton violence and bloodshed?§!"

With her family's resources and access to nearly anything she desired, Alcippe flitted from interest to interest, at times overwhelmed with the possibilities ahead of her and unable to choose what to dedicate her life to. After attending university in Vesalipolis and changing majors three times, Alcippe enlisted in the Heer just in time for the Canterlot Invasion of 1002, where she participated as a hoof soldier assigned to Unterfeldwebel Jachs' company. After she and her company successfully captured the Element Bearers and brought them to Queen Chrysalis, Alcippe found herself promoted in the reorganization of the Heer following the defeat. She was given the choice between staying with Jachs' 96. Infanterie or accepting a position into the Queen's Guard, but decided to stay with her superior officer in 1002 as a member of his staff. This relationship would prove to be a fruitful one, as Oberst Jachs and Major Alcippe would successfully take Canterlot using a carefully executed strategy they developed, and when Oberst Jachs, then a Generalmajor, was assigned the task of garrisoning and holding Canterlot, he tapped Alcippe to come with him as his second in command. Alcippe, now an Oberstleutnant and a great admirer of her superior officer, finds herself tasked with executing Generalmajor Jachs' decisions throughout the entirety of central Equestria. The rigors of the Pax Chrysalia will put her convictions to the test, and she looks to Jachs to steer them both right as they navigate the tough task of maintaining the changelings' hold over Equestria.§!"

His family consisted of poor dockyard workers, largely ostracized from society, and Marsilio initially grew up resentful of the deer and ponies in the city who viewed his kind with deep and unflinching suspicion. Determined to make a better life for himself, Marsilio made frequent use of the city's largest library, educating himself in all manner of topics he did not otherwise have access to in the city. His efforts paid off, and he was able to attend the University of Acornage in 981, where changeling and pony scholars worked in close tandem. There, he would meet a young stallion by the name of Spectrograph, and after becoming unlikely best friends, Marsilio's worldview on ponies and deer changed. The two graduated at the top of their class, and Marsilio left Acornage to venture to Vesalipolis to further his studies with his new worldview in mind. Marsilio excelled in Vesalipolis, earning his doctorate and originally finding work along the Changeling-Olenian border as a medical doctor. He even planned on returning to Vanhoover to continue his work and provide medical treatment for changelings in the multicultural city.\n\nThat all changed following the failed Canterlot Invasion of 1002, where in the aftermath, pony riots torched much of the ethnically changeling quarters of Vanhoover, sending refugees fleeing into the Changeling Lands. Instead of returning to Vanhoover, Marsilio decided to look after the refugees fleeing into Vesalipolis, where he eventually attracted the attention of the Royal Changeling Heer due to his expertise in changeling, deer, and pony biology and anatomy. Marsilio would quickly rise through the ranks as he worked to modernize changeling love extraction, eventually becoming surgeon-general of the Royal Changeling Heer by the time Olenia became a protectorate of the Hegemony. He would eventually move his headquarters to Seaddle, right across the Luna Bay from his old home in Vanhoover, and become much more closely involved in the Pax Chrysalia with his work on love extraction. His efforts to improve love extraction to be a painless and ethical process for the Hegemony's new subjects eventually put him in contact with Generalmajor Jachs, and after finding that they share many of the same ideas on treating ponies with respect, the two changelings became fast friends. Now the two seek to do what many consider impossible: turn the Pax Chrysalia from a brutal oppression of ponies and deer to a cooperation between the hives and their fallen foes.§!"

CHN_jachs_drawer_finicus_card_tt_delayed:0 "§YBorn:§!§LApril 1, 979\n\nFinicus Vesali was always destined to be the heir to his father's company, Main Hives Industries, from the moment he was born. From a young age, he was groomed to take over the sprawling corporation, a powerhouse that his father worked tirelessly to improve and expand until his death in 1005 from an automobile accident. At the young age of 26, Finicus found himself thrust into command of the Hegemony's largest producer of heavy machinery, a situation that would have broken many less competent changelings. Finicus, however, had been prepared well by his father, and immediately turned Main Hives' attention to the wars to come. By forcing out competitors, hiring all the best talent they could afford, and filing thousands upon thousands of defensive and speculative patents, Finicus turned MHI into the greatest industrial giant in the Changeling Hives, and established its total monopoly in the area of heavy industry. Then, sensing the wars to come, Finicus made MHI practically inseparable from the Royal Changeling Heer, providing it reliable and cheap equipment in exchange for lucrative exclusive contracts. By the time the Great War started, every machine that was used to make every part of every last bit of war materiel, from the transmission of trucks to the treads of tanks to the bolts of rifles, was built and provided by Main Hive Industries to the factories that kept the war effort going. Finicus had become unfathomably personally wealthy as a result of his successful business deals, finding himself as one of the richest changelings in all of the Hegemony, yet even then, something eluded him.\n\nFinicus had never wanted to take over MHI. As a grub, he had been more interested in artistic pursuits, but those were quickly shut down by his father. Now, at the conclusion of the Great War, Finicus has captained one of the most successful companies to ever exist to untold success, yet even that has failed to satisfy him. In meeting Generalmajor Jachs, however, Finicus has found an opportunity to turn Main Hive Industry's vast resources from producing weapons of death to the tools of peace. Maybe, just maybe, Finicus will be able to find personal satisfaction in making the Pax Chrysalia a better time to live, and not a worse one.§!"

CHN_jachs_drawer_second_wind_card_tt_delayed:0 "§YBorn:§! §LNovember 5, 976\n\nFrom his earliest memories, Second Wind knew he was destined to be a soldier. Born far above the ground in the city of Cloudsdale, Second Wind came from a long line of soldiers, dating all the way back to the genesis of Nightmare Moon almost a thousand years prior. Soldiering was in his blood, much like it is for most of the pegasus race, and he immediately enlisted with the Royal Guard upon turning 18 in 994.\n\nThe next decade would be a busy one for Second Wind. He was present in Canterlot during the infamous Canterlot Invasion of 1002, where after a brief clash with changeling soldiers on the outskirts of the city, he rallied together members of the Guard that were patrolling the perimeter at the time of the attack and organized a counterattack with the aim of retaking the royal palace. Thanks to Princess Cadance and Shining Armor, such a counterattack was unnecessary, and Second Wind's chance to prove himself came and went without him being able to seize it. Not being from a noble house like many of the unicorn members, Second Wind found his chances for a promotion slim and practically nonexistent. He seemed destined to spend his years in the service on the lower echelons looking up, where the officer corps was staffed by nobles that more often than not bought their way in using their names and familial pedigree. There was perhaps no surprise to be found there that Second Wind, born from a proud military family, had little chance of advancement when the unicorn nobility treated the organization as just another political body to dominate.\n\nThat changed during the Great War, where the mass mobilization of Equestria and the bloody fighting that followed gave Second Wind the chance he desired to prove his worth. He fought valiantly throughout the war, but even then, his long-overdue promotion only came when the fighting was all but lost and the Royal Guard was desperately looking for officers to fill its ranks. When Equestria capitulated and the new Royal and Imperial Canterlot Guard was established, Second Wind defected and became the head of the organization. Now, Second Wind watches the Pax Chrysalia be enforced on his species, himself serving as a tool to the changelings to keep his people under control. How long can a proud pegasus soldier bow to a foreign conqueror and keep his own kind in chains before something has to give?§!"

But what is known about her is enough to confirm her as a powerful ally... or a dangerous enemy. Gloriosa is the matron of the Cornucopia Society, an organization that has its roots in a long-since faded unicorn supremacy movement, but now caters to unicorns looking for a form of escapism from the tolls of the world by functioning as a drug den. Many lesser nobles are frequent visitors of the Society, operating out of the old Hotel Calihornia, and the Society has found a way to manufacture a powerful drug made from a pony's love, fashioned in a way that not even changelings have been able to perfect. It is unclear how closely the Society is or was involved in resistance activity in Canterlot before joining forces with Generalmajor Jachs, but the society is undoubtedly powerful and influential, and if Gloriosa has an interest in something happening in her city, she always finds a way to put a hoof on the scale and give it a little tip. For now, she serves as a useful ally to Generalmajor Jachs, but how much can anybody afford to trust a mare who hides behind a mask?§!

CHN_jachs_drawer_dropper_tt_delayed:0 "§LThis vial of refined love was given to Jachs by Finicus Vesali as a sample of the new and advanced love extraction and refinement now performed by industrial concerns such as Main Hives Industry. Before the war, love could not be reliably stored after its extraction, as it would lose its potency within minutes of being drawn from a victim. The traditional solution to this dilemma was to envelop hapless victims in cocoons, where their dreams would produce a steady and reliable source of love for a hive. However, love harvested in this manner can often be tainted by the context of the victim's dreams, and the victims could not survive being trapped in cocoons and harvested for more than a few months. Nowadays, however, the changeling industry giants have found ways to extract and contain love without it losing its potency, allowing it to be harvested from far-away towns and brought directly back to factories, where it is further refined and processed using recently rediscovered magical runes and processes to remove any unpleasant emotions that may have slipped into the love during collection. In this manner, the love that is now widely available to the hives is purer, stronger, and much cheaper to acquire than ever before.§!"

The movie was a stirring work of cinema advocating for peace and friendship in the frightening lens of the first industrial war ever seen on the continent of Equus, condemning Queen Chrysalis and her armies through thinly-veiled satire. The movie is most remembered for Cheerful Chap's moving speech at its climax where, disguised as the Shifter King of a fictional monarchy, he advocates for peace and begs the soldiers of the nation to throw down their weapons and be kind to each other instead of cruel. Though all copies of the film that could be found were burned by the furious Queen Chrysalis once Equestria fell, Generalmajor Jachs had managed to save a copy of the film, along with several other Equestrian works, for his personal collection. The movie is a personal favorite of his and Alcippe's.§!"

Thankfully, alcohol can help chase those stresses away, and it's easier to get than love, especially when the citizens of the city you rule over have none to spare for you. Jachs regularly orders shipments of Stalliongradian vodka from the northeast to help calm his nerves after a stressful day, and there certainly are more of those days than he cares for. A little drinking on the job every so often is excusable when the stability of the Pax Chrysalia is almost entirely held together by one determined bug's exhausted efforts.§!"
