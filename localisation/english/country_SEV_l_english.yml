#Names

sev_dual_administration_desc:0 "The Severyanan Protectorate (or Severyanan Exclusion Zone to those outside it) is a region split between two factions, both of whom have a disdain for each other matched only by their disdain for the local ponies.\n\nOn the right side of the nation, covering the coastline and a stretch of land that reaches to the capital city, are the territories held by parts of the Vhy, a pro-Imperial extremist organization. They are led by Kommandant Rosin Lyctia, a visionary biolinguist and personal friend of Captain Dieter Heinrich himself, who is the tyrant of the army that he must turn into a government.\n\nOn the other side, Prandialists own most of the interior land, and they plunder it as is convenient. They are represented by Urbiates orn Marks, who wields significant influence through his personal popularity while also being someone who the Vhy can communicate with consistently."

Their leader, One March, adores the ultra-collectivist changeling way of thinking and desires to bring it to his homeland. He has come from humble beginnings to do so."

sev_council_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: Indeterminate\n§YRank§!: High\n§YBiography§!: The Prandialists traditionally do not recognize dedicated officers within their hierarchy. Certain individuals do seem to gravitate towards leading roles, but their authority is never considered higher than that of the masses around them. "Councils" are the true wielders of power and legitimacy in Prandialist society. Councils are created around pre-existing communities, usually single hives but sometimes smaller units like districts or larger units like regions or even the entire Prandialist sphere. They make every decision that needs to be made, from drudgery like taxation to more kinetic matters like warfare. A military campaign may be organized by a council with a voting population that includes everyone from the lowliest foot soldier to the most respected dancer to your travelling cousin who is writing in by mail.\nDespite being faceless masses, councils do still seem to have personalities, memories, quirks, and other features of more traditional leaders. Some are better at managing internal politics, others at waging war, and a few are just plain barbarous."

sev_utan:0 "Clypeus "Utan" Kladisum"
sev_utan_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 17 May, 965 in Kladisium\n§YRank§!: Generalmajor\n§YBiography§!: Little is known about Utan's life before the military. They aren't prone to sharing details casually, and they didn't legally exist until the 7th Blodtruppen stumbled across them in Equestria. They recruited him into their ranks in a series of events which won't be repeated for time, but suffice it to say that the arrest warrants are public records. Ever since, he's been travelling with the 7th as an officer, possibly against his will, and that he may be a descendant of an old monarchic lineage who's hive was destroyed centuries ago, but that can't be confirmed since the prandialists burned the archives in 855.\nThat said, the gross incompetence that tends to follow the 7th apparently burnt itself out on him when he was recruited, making him a trusty commander, at least compared to his peers. Over the war, he was promoted many times. When the Vhy divisions of Severyana arrived and found themselves poaching any possible staff they could find to run their logistics and other resource needs, Utan got one more boost to Generalmajor.\n§YPortrait By§!: Opal Radiance"

sev_oldman:0 "Gerentor Lyctia"
sev_oldman_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 14 August, 927 in Lyctida\n§YRank§!: Generaloberst\n§YBiography§!: In the Changeling Lands, disdain for the foreign nation is normal, but disdain for the foreigner is not. After all, their distrust of the changelings is rational and reasonable, and if that is understandable then what else about them is simply a difference of opinion?\nGerentor has never agreed with this. He wasn't nearly left-leaning enough to join the Prandialists, although they would have loved to have him, but by the Queen did he not like those ponies. For him, the Vhy was a group that could finally represent his views. He has been a loyal follower ever since he discovered them.\nFrom his beginnings as an officer in the Lyctidan Army to now, his military career has become longer than most lives. For his loyalty, experience, and skill, he has now found himself as the head of the Vhy's land forces in the Zone. Bizarrely, although he's never had issues adjusting to a new position, he still hasn't stopped behaving like this promotion came last week.\n§YPortrait By§!: Triplesevens"

sev_rosin_leader:0 "Dr. Rosin Lyctia"
sev_rosin_leader_desc:0 "When Dieter appeared in the Lyctida hinterlands and began building his own personal army, one of his first comrades was Rosin R. Lyctia, son of upper-class dronic parents. Over the years, the two remained allies and friends, at least inasmuch as Dieter Heinrich is capable of forming emotional bonds. Dieter pledged himself to Queen Chrysalis's cause and became her head of security, while Rosin dedicated himself to the study of the changeling languages, unique among the known languages because they are discovered rather than learned.\nIn the early 1000's, Rosin participated in an expedition across Griffonia to the then-unknown nation of Greneclyf, where he learned Greneclyfian and produced thousands of pages on it, famously theorizing that the Greneclyfians were not independently created but were in fact a divergent branch of the Equus changelings, and their language was different because of centuries of drift. Ironically, he is the one who is least certain about the truth of that theory, despite its acceptance by the government and the subsequent shower of awards.\nIn 1006 he was chosen as the successor to Dieter Heinrich in the role of Queen Chrysalis's head bodyguard and began training for such. In 1008, he was made general of the 3rd Vhy 'Lyctida' due to the need for experienced leaders in the rapidly-growing changeling armies. After the war, he was made Kommandant of the Severyana Protectorate against his wishes, and he and his division were sent to keep an eye on the Prandialists who were also forced to live there."
sev_urbiates_leader:0 "Urbiates orn Marks"
sev_urbiates_leader_desc:0 "If you look into the history of Urbiates orn Marks, most of what you find will ultimately come from his own words. Nearly nothing can be corroborated. This is not shocking, Lyctida had very poor record-keeping when he would have been growing up and by his own admission he spent most of his time around other Prandialists, who are notorious for never writing anything down.\nSome things are known for sure. In his mid-twenties, he rose to prominence as a passionate speaker and ultraviolent radical who personally led numerous militias against Stalliongrad-style socialist groups who were gaining traction at the time. His version of the ideology declared that Marks was secretly a changeling who's works were aimed at the Prandialists while sowing chaos amongst the hated red-bloods, and that literacy was mostly a way for anti-changeling-drone propaganda to be pushed to the masses. The former idea became accepted, and the latter was not, but it is believed he is still illiterate to this day.\nIn his late twenties, he gained national fame for his speeches and (dictated) articles, most of which are furious racial diatribes and all of which are incomrehensible to anyone who thinks too hard about them. He became the face of Prandialism to the changeling government due to being the only figure of significant influence who maintaines regular lines of communication."
sev_tengage_publishing:0 "Tengage Publishing"
sev_tengage_publishing_desc:0 "Formed nearly a century ago, Tengage Publishing is the oldest known non-Royal publishing company from the Changeling Lands. They specialize in serial printings, such as the "New Machinery Quarterly", a magazine for industrial workers and managers, and "How to Kill", a monthly publication popular with everyone from beat cops and hoof-infantry around the continent to Fallschirmjaegers and even some VOPS operatives.\nTheir most prolific series, however, and by far their most controversial, is "Handicapped Grandpa Weekly", a magazine combining signal/radio hobbyism, erotica, and that peculiar changelingish form of left-wing politics which equates authenticity with intellectual merit and illiteracy with charm. Urbiates orn Marks is a favorite recurring contributor, as are Proletarii the anti-Marksist-Stallionst satire persona and Endophal the pornographic cartoon artist.\nIn the Changeling Lands, owning an issue of Handicapped Grandpa can result in up to two years in prison. Nearly all of the employees of Tengage Publishing were coincidentally exiled to the Severyana Exclusion Zone for their Prandialist politics, and thus the company is now based there."
sev_doot_suit:0 "Kissan Lantio"
sev_doot_suit_desc:0 "While Mr. Lantio's presence among the Vhy's ranks might seem odd at first with their stringent and often-peculiar criteria, it's entirely logical. With a record like his, they actively looked to pick him up for further cooperation. He "was an anti-government agent in Olenia" (was repeatedly arrested for running guns and drugs and pornography). He "held strong nationalist views" (once beat a communist into the hospital with a lead pipe for spreading pro-union sentiments among the prostitutes he was pimping). He "practiced changeling-style love collection on his own initiative" (slept with many deer who were women or at least looked like it at the time). He "is a devotee of traditional medicine" (hits the clubs to get drunk and/or high at least once per week). He "is well-bred and of good standing" (has slept around a lot and can hold himself upright, unless he has been hitting the clubs). He "is a changeling" (Olenians are honorary changelings).\nMost importantly, he "has a record of exercizing the utmost discernment" (will do anything to avoid going to a Vesalipolis prison)."

sev_red_basic_economics_desc:0 "Our need for materials can be determined mathematically, with each changeling needing some number of calories and love, and each pony being able to provide some amount of both.

sev_red_very_arcane:0 "Garage Sale"
sev_red_very_arcane_desc:0 "Stalliongrad was a progressive nation, and that meant that they recognized that ponies have more magic than intrinsic value.

sev_grey_start_desc:0 "For years now, we've had a suspicion that Equalism was not about bringing everypony down to the same level, but was instead about making them realize the smallness of the individual before the collective. And now what has happened to those who disagreed? They lost to the changelings, the living example of our principles."
sev_grey_ideas:0 "Mutual Aggression Pact"
sev_grey_ideas_desc:0 "The White Equalists have much to offer the Stalliongradian... Severyanan project, but they require much themselves. Being able to lead their own militias without fear of reprisal shouldn't be so hard considering that they could never defeat the other two parties with them, right?"
sev_grey_taxes:0 "Budget Expanse"
sev_grey_taxes_desc:0 "Somehow, in all the chaos and upheaval of Severyana's recent history, the system of tributes never actually was restored to full order. No quotas, no taxes, nothing. This is one place where the Equalists can definitely do good work for their new benefactors in return for something important."
sev_grey_rebel:0 "Bundle of Carrots"
sev_grey_rebel_desc:0 "Understandably, neither of the other groups running the country are particularly good at dealing with the common pony, still so absorbed in their selves and their individuality.

sev_grey_names:0 "Enhanced Truth"

sev_grey_diplomacy:0 "Foreign Exchange"
sev_grey_diplomacy_desc:0 "In an age of globalization and monolithic entities, being a pariah state is a path to destruction. The world may not be able to understand our outlook, but that just means we have to explain it to them in a way that makes it sound like they understand it."
sev_grey_propaganda:0 "Sharpness of the Pen"
sev_grey_propaganda_desc:0 "Another thing which the Equalist's allies have failed to do is properly set up a propaganda war. Sure, they've got the setup for one, but between the comically unbelievable lies and the chronic overuse of what-abouts, it's nearly useless. One thing Severyana's former owners knew was propaganda, and they left plenty of things to study."
sev_grey_flag:0 "Three Arrows"
sev_grey_flag_desc:0 "Fascism, Communism, and Monarchy. Once upon a time, the Republicans promised to destroy all three. Yet sometimes the strong must fear the weak and organized, and to celebrate our monumental new state, and the new age to come, we shall be made an official part of the governance."
sev_grey_cooperation:0 "Horseshoe Diplomacy"
sev_grey_cooperation_desc:0 "Even though the Equalists are a neutral third party, the Prandialists and Vhy have decades of viscious history. Both of them have all the martial power in the nation, though, so their disputes each represent an existential threat."
sev_grey_jobs:0 "Role Equality"
sev_grey_jobs_desc:0 "Sadly, to keep a state functioning requires many different kinds of work. The repetitive motions of the factory are different from the repetitive thoughts of the offices, and they are both different from others. We need to categorize and sterilize every role we can so that there are few enough different lives to live through employment."
sev_grey_corporation:0 "A Friend Named Barter"
sev_grey_corporation_desc:0 "Severyana was and is a state rich in resources, which we have no use for now that we are at peace with the world. We can only store so much oil, but lack so many goods that are only made abroad. Maybe it is time to open the markets a bit, to let other nations get a piece of our pie?"
sev_grey_big_plan:0 "Equality in One State"
sev_grey_big_plan_desc:0 "Every drop of water is equal, and given time, can turn the most radical stone into a smooth, spherical pebble. By whatever means it takes, if the Equalists can establish and protect their ideals in even one town, they will eventually come to dominate all, and now they have much of a country. In a thousand years if necessary, the world will be ours."
sev_grey_race:0 "Racial Equality"
sev_grey_race_desc:0 "The root of division, in Severyana as with everywhere else, is inequality of virtually any kind. It may be a tautology that if everyone were the same, none would be different, but that also makes it true. To break the barrier between one and another, a Severyanan 'culture' should be created, one which all legal art and entertainment must fit into."
sev_grey_ultimate_end:0 "Tensegrity Sculpture"
sev_grey_ultimate_end_desc:0 "The balance between the three factions of the country is based on their competing areas of expertise. What one group can do casually, another can only do with preparation, and the last cannot do at all. A functioning state therefore requires all three to work together, and the result is groundbreaking."

With three implacable evils turning on one another, the thinking went that the forces of right couldn't help but win.\n\nUnfortunately, what came next was not so simple as that idealized world.\n\nIf you wish to try to change the fate of the Severyana Exclusion Zone, for better or for worse, you may. Be warned, however, that what awaits shall be misery, barbarism, zealotry, and more gore than four score Great Wars. There is no shame in staying on the kinder side of the border, that you may smother your child in its sleep when the time is right.

severyana_a.1.d:0 "Doctor Rosin R. Lyctia, PhD. in Biolinguistics, recipient of the 1003 Queen's Highest Excellence in Progress award for his work both discovering and unraveling Greneclyfian, former Generalmajor of the 3rd "Lyctidia" division and current Kommandant of all Vhy personnel in the Severyana Protectorate, looked out the window of his new thirteenth-floor office, once of the most significant rooms in the world, and wished he was home.\n\nIt wasn't the fact that now he was working with Prandialists so closely that Stalliongrad was split between the two factions, although he wasn't a fan. It wasn't the noise outside his office, as construction workers added new walls where the Palace of the Soviets was bisected by the lines on the map. It wasn't the fact that he was in the Palace of the Soviets at all, in the office which used to belong to the General Secretary and hadn't been completely picked clean. It was that he wasn't sure why he was in charge of a nation. All he knew was that he had been chosen by the Queen, apparently personally, and had to make do.\n\nOutside his window was Stalliongrad, although the name was already on the path to being changed, like the city itself. It had been torn apart by its conquest, and the Prandialists, barbarians as usual, were keeping it in pieces. The only reason the gunfire had stopped was that they had started to find shooting boring. Supposedly, part of his job was keeping them restrained and in this country, but he didn't have a clue how. At least he had time to figure it out.\n\nHis idle wondering was interrupted by the tremendous crash of a changeling on a chair falling through the ceiling. It was Urbiates, his liaison with the Prandialists, who was lying on the floor in pain. "It's not bolted to the floor, Urbiates... It just needs some convincing, Urbiates..." He groaned. "Oh, hey, Rosin." He continued."

We're just figuring our way around this place."\n\nRosin didn't bother to get out of his chair. "It's 'Kommandant' Rosin. What the hell are you wearing?"\n\nUrbiates grasped at his coat. "Oh, we found this upstairs. Apparently it's from Bronze Hill, wherever that is. I just think it fits our branding. Look, it's even got our symbol! Kind of! And since I'm here... Hey, Octy! That guy I was telling you about is down here!"\n\nA smaller changeling wearing a stolen Red Army uniform floated down through the hole. "The gay one?"\n\n"Yeah, that one." Urbiates shook like a dog, causing pieces of plaster to fall out of his jacket.\n\n'Octy' landed and held his hoof out over the desk. "Octopxhbin, at your service. Got to ask, did it hurt when you fell out of someone's ass?"\n\nRosin stared at him. "Charmed. Did it hurt when you got deported from your home country?"\n\nOcty looked confused. "I... wait, how did you know about that?"\n\n"You do a remarkable job hiding your Greneclyfian accent considering you don't hide your name, but I can still make out your dennite drawl on top of it, and I can put two and two together. Now get out of here, I have actual work to do." Rosin explained.\n\n"Alright, if you insist. Have a good day, comrade budski." Urbiates said as he left through the office's front door. Octy followed, sticking his tongue out at Rosin. Then the office was as it had been, barring the debris in the center and the hole in the ceiling. The thing he wanted to do least was deal with those two, but he had to. Urbiates was the only Prandialist of note who he could regularly communicate with, which had always been the case, and neither faction could subdue the entirety of Severyana on their own. If he couldn't live with them, they would all die without them."

It's why it was actually fairly unusual that someone got fast-tracked high enough up the ranks that he appeared in that very office. But there he was, saying "Unterkapitan Jenom, at your service, sir."\n\nRosin put down the set of papers detailing the rest of the continent's goings-on. "Oh? Who are you?"\n\n"Unterkapitan Jenom, sir." The other changeling replied. He was a royal, tall and proud and with their long hair in a bright red.\n\nRosin barely kept the annoyance off his face. "I heard you the first time, I'm asking why you were told to see me directly."\n\nSitting in the seat across the desk and adopting a terrible posture, Jenom replied, "I'm the one who was organizing anti-partisan activities in the Southern region until it was given independence. Now that they have their own structures for it, I've been sent here to assist your own counter-terror dealings." He pulled out a toothpick and started cleaning between his teeth. "I think you'll find that I was very effective."\n\nRosin decided to not mention that the article he had been reading was on a changeling governor in the Southern Protectorate who had been tortured to death by their biggest domestic rebel group last week. It must have fallen apart very quickly without Jenom's intervention. "Well, I'm glad to have you, Unterkapitan. I'll get you placed in charge of counter-terror operations, and find an office for you."\n\nJenom grinned. "This will be the beginning of a very productive relationship. Trust me.""

She'll keep you safe, she'll keep you informed, and she can't be replaced, so if you can't protect her you need to send her back to us!"\n\n"Okay! What is she?" Rosin yelled back, barely able to hear himself think.\n\n"She's a reader! She reads other creatures! That's why we need her back, so also send her over if you don't need her anymore!" The officer explained. His hat nearly blew off in the wind.\n\n"I don't know what a reader is! Can you have the pilot turn the engine off so that we can talk in peace? I can't hear myself think!" Rosin replied.\n\n"No, it's fine, we'll be out of here in a second!" The officer shouted back. "The most important part is that she can tell when a changeling is disguised just by being within the same room! That's such a big deal that if the airport here ever takes damage, you need to get her to a different town so that it won't stop her from being able to leave!" He turned and got back onto the stairs up to the passenger compartment. The submachinegun-armed guard who had been watching got out of his way as he turned around to finally yell, "She can describe how it works better! Just don't get her killed because we'll want her back at some point!"\n\nAs he closed the door and the propellers spun up, Rosin waved a guard over, and the two pulled the confused blind girl away from the plane that was already moving to the runway to take off again. He already wished that they had taken the time to explain what exactly they had dropped on him as support, since he had it in his grasp and he knew barely more than last week when he was told "someone is being sent over".

The backseat of the staff car was the first place where they could talk without hurting her ability to navigate, and he decided to use it. "What's your name, miss?"\n\n"My name is Tarea, Tarea Sor. What about you?" She asked back, looking ahead flatly.\n\n"I'm Kommandant Rosin Lyctia." He replied, worried that she didn't know. "You're in the Severyan Protectorate.

The Queen seems to think you're very valuable."\n\nTarea paused. "Well, I'm a reader. I can see beings, and I can... well, I can see them when they're behind something that doesn't hide them." She looked at him, or at least in his direction as she was still wearing the blindfold. "I can see that you're there, but I can't see your face, or your eyes, just your existence. And if you were disguised, I'd see that, too, like a sheet over a piece of furniture. Before you ask, I don't know what's under the sheet, just that it's covering something. I can't tell existences apart, you and the guard and the driver look the same to me."\n\nRosin exhaled. "Well, that still kind of is a big deal. Color me impressed. Is there anything else?"\n\n"Yeah." She began. "As part of my enchantment, I'm not allowed to see violence, wear black, or have anything but water on the eighth day of the Royal week.

It's the right thing to do, although I know that concept gives you trouble." Rosin lied.\n\nUrbiates mimed wiping a tear from his eye. "How touching. Anyways, we came to say that we've found a weird thing and we want you to have it because we're too lazy to take it apart." A collection of pictures fell onto the table, along with a stained napkin with an address written on it.\n\nRosin picked up one of the photos and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was at least fifty percent useful information.

Two black-clad Vhy soldiers stood watch, in case anyone thought that they could make one right move and drag away a week's worth of food, Prandialists included. It was a common sight in the urban areas, and had been ever since the famine.\n\n"It's actually things like this that are the big question," the scrawny changeling continued. "Every pony has an opinion on whether we should maintain the Stalliongradian state-controlled economy or allow for individual entrepreneurship. It's fairly split."\n\n"I can imagine. What do you recommend?" Rosin asked.\n\n"Don't do it, if we control the economy then we control the entire country. Even the parts owned by the Prandialists." Jenom chimed in. "We won't be able to enforce anything under a free market. We won't even know who to call."\n\n"Well, sort of." The other changeling cleaned his glasses against his coat. "But there are ways to control even the freest market. We'd know who was rich, obviously. The major benefit is that we wouldn't have to maintain anything ourselves if we didn't have a reason to. We can always undo it later if some field demands it, too."\n\nRosin rubbed his chin. Another pony shuffled out of the line. Every one of them wasn't working, yet they were still maintaining themselves. It was inefficient, but that wasn't bad. His official role was "Minister of the Severyana Protectorate". His charter didn't call for him to make the state wealthy and prosperous, so even if a controlled economy impoverished and depowered the common pony, would that really be so bad?"

"We're already instituting fish catching and farming programs, it will just take a year before they can sustainably feed us."\n\n"Okay!" Rosin shouted. "So it's not a total disaster. What can we do to keep our armies fed for one year? Suggestions?"\n\nJenom stood up. "Our work camp program is proceeding well. Soon it will begin to report the planned attrition. If we increase the processing rate, we can sustain ourselves off of the dead prisoners and increase productivity."\n\nIvl Meknasti also stood up. "We don't need to boost our bodycount just to make our ends meet! We already process a substantial number of ponies through our normal anti-partisan activities. In our raids and especially executions, we can merely collect the bodies and use those as our extra food." Meknasti puffed out his chest with pride.

Rosin had to tip his hat to the Marksists, they knew how to get rid of the folks they didn't like. It was a shame their biology didn't let them use every part of the malfeasant.\n\nDeltapolis, like many similar facilities, was being converted so that the inmates' processing didn't end with them being worked to death. When they became too exhausted to continue, they would be taken into a side chamber, exposed to a lethal dosage of gas, and mechanically drained of love before being sent to the corpse pit. If needed, the gas could be washed off the meat and that could also be consumed. The purpose of Rosin's visit was to be present before the extra sections were activated.\n\nHis car arrived just behind a new group of prisoners, from unemployed bums to partisans. The prison owner met him and led him to a raised balcony where much of the complex of trenches and mines could be seen. "Inmates of Vorkuta, now called Deltapolis!" He called out. Some prisoners stopped and looked at the new voice, and as they were not beaten by the guards for it, more joined them. "I have come to you with an offer! Many of you have been scorned by your old masters, and new service under the Vhy for the good of the Severyanan Protectorate is an ample way to not only avenge yourself but to crawl out of this hole!" By now, nearly all eyes were on him. "Those of you who wish to come with me, simply step forward!"\n\nThe prisoners stared. Then they looked at each other, and to the prisoners on their other side.

He'd always meant to look up the historical context, how someone thought a method of execution that played into all the worst aspects of creaturedom and then applied it so liberally it became a concept, but never had the time, and now it felt like he never would.

We just won't mention it."\n\n"Isn't lying a bit pedestrian for you?" She asked.\n\n"No such thing." Rosin replied. "If we're done here, then I have better things to do than talk to a pony dressed in chitin. Good day." He turned and walked back to the railcar with his guards, and the driver restarted the gasoline engine. The first emigrants had been received without issue and the program could begin in earnest. As he stepped onto the metal device and soon felt it shift back towards his side of the border, he wondered how much it hurt that traitor that her movement was once again helping the cause of the Changeling race."

Rosin had dealt with banks as much as any common pony had, and he understood these things well as things which he needed to operate around. However, he was not an economist, a fact which he had always known and had been constantly reminded of anyways. "So how did you handle banking in the South?" He asked Jenom, who he had requested assist in the creation of a Severyanan national bank.\n\n"It was very easy. We simply declared that the existing banks could accept Changeling Marks at some rate in exchange for Bits, and then we let the ponies set up the overarching structure themselves." Jenom recounted.\n\n"So what do we need to do it ourselves?" Rosin asked.\n\n"Bureaucrats and gold," Jenom answered. "Well, we don't need gold, but it makes it easier."\n\n"Fatherland took all the gold the first time. And silver, platinum, precious gems, artworks, artifacts, guns..." Rosin admitted. "So if we're going without, then what?"\n\nJenom thought. "Well, then we're probably going to be stuck with something called 'fiat currency'. It's like money, except it only has value because everyone agrees it does so that they can trade with it. At least, I think that's how it works."\n\n"Wait, that doesn't make sense." Ivl Meknasti was suddenly standing in the doorway. "Sorry, Kommandant, but I was listening in from outside. His description of fiat currency doesn't mesh with anything I've seen. Surely, if the value is simply agreed-upon, then that value can be pushed and pulled by bullying by one of the parties buying or selling?"\n\n"No, that's what national banks do." Rosin interjected. "Or at least, what this one would do. It would say how much the money is worth and then enforce that."\n\nMeknasti cocked his head. "Then it's backed by government might."\n\n"Or trust." Jenom interjected. "Oh, right, it's our government. I see your point."\n\n"So... how about we back the currency directly with our military?" Meknasti suggested."

However, cut off as we are, we have not been able to produce more, and our proud warriors have taken to requisitioning from the local population. Some pay for it, and thereby support the partisan suppliers of the drug dealers with money. Others don't pay, and support the partisans with offended criminals who want revenge." Rosin paused for a second to let the situation sink in. "I believe we should establish a nationalized pharmaceutical corporation to supply our army with the chemicals it needs... which can turn a profit by selling medicine to the ponies since we really really need money for our new banking system. I am, however, open to suggestions."\n\nThe changelings in the crowd discussed among themselves, or sat in their chairs and thought. An Olenian who had found his way into the high command had the words translated to him by a friend, and raised his cloven hoof. "Ey, sir!" He spoke in a vulgar form of his native language. "Why keep all the good stuff for yourself? These damned ponies wouldn't be able to hold a gun if they were schwacked out on good opium! And they'd pay us for the privilege! Us! And not whatever strangers they get it from now!"\n\nMost of his subordinates did not speak Olenian at all, so Rosin repeated the deer's suggestion for their benefit."But we can't do that!" Some logistics officer called out. "We are a respectable military, not a drug empire! How are we supposed to be taken seriously as a government if we primarily make money from selling heroin?" It was a real concern. Tax collection was spotty at best and plunder at worst, and the public perception of the nation was that it wasn't doing enough to stop the terrorists, or really any problem.\n\nSo what to do with the drugs?"

He saw the changeling in charge of the Volkskompromiss program walking up to him excitedly, and was struck by the fact that the Stalliongradian government had destroyed a centuries-old Solarist cathedral to build the Palace, just like his soldiers were renovating similar buildings around the country to introduce deities who could better explain to the ponies what the new order was.\n\nWhat was the excuse of the Stalliongradians?\n\n"Heil Chrysalis, friend!" The other changeling exclaimed, saluting. "Did you see the new signs on the way in?"\n\n"I forgot to look." Rosin admitted after saluting back. "How goes the program? It sounds like it's progressing well."\n\n"Indeed it is!" He replied, nearly yelling. "Besides changelingizing the street names, we're also doing it to the towns, the institutions, the museums, the theaters, and the laws. We will move on to the clothing and more later. So far, the ponies have been surprisingly willing to accept their new Olenian gods, but..." Rosin raised an eyebrow at him. "...Well, we haven't been able to do that in the Prandialist parts of town. Their goons are organizing into squads that patrol the streets and keep us from it. Something about not liking the gods in question."\n\n"That's the worst problem you could have had as far as I'm concerned." Rosin stated.

"I'd say it wasn't my fault, but I don't think either of us would be fooled."\n\n"Okay, I guess there are two reasons I've asked to speak with you." Rosin added. "The thing I actually had in mind were some reports that your hive's fighters were getting into spats with our soldiers over our recent decisions regarding acceptable religions. We chose the Olenian pantheon to be the nation's sole legal religion for ponies because of its focus on the rights of the conquerors and the servitude of the defeated, yet for some reason many of your friends dislike that message." He turned suddenly. "Care to explain why?"\n\nUrbiates stared dully at him. He sighed annoyedly. "You want to know why we don't like that? It's because, unlike you, we like changelings. We don't care what the Habbababoloba or whatever thinks about winners and losers, because we already know it's Olenian, and therefore the god to a bunch of savages who hate us for breathing. Is that hard to understand?"\n\nRosin pounded his hoof on the table. "And yet you would replace it with our own ideas, which posit that we are freaks of nature that are rightfully hated by the entire world? Yes, elaborate."\n\n"It's because it's ours." Urbiates stated. "See, this is why nobody likes your black-suited thugs, Rosin. You claim to love our race more than anyone else, but you have nothing but problems with our way of life. You only like the idea of us. Your boss wasn't even a changeling by birth." He yawned. "So can you please let your delusions remain in your head, and let us spread the 'changeling way' that you supposedly adore so much?"\n\n"Do I have to call in the soldiers?"

It was a mountain pass in the north-west that was constantly guarded by soldiers, moreso than all other known border crossing areas. It was the only legal way because getting sent to Severyana was so significant that only the Queen could order it, and she only ever ordered the crossing be made here, in a humid valley between two massive peaks. Of course, the first set of divisions had simply arrived with the rest of the army and then never left. Normally the pass was for new Prandialists imports and no one else. The beautiful view was wasted on them.\n\nToday, the pass was alive once again, and with good news. Thousands of soldiers from across the border were arriving, all veterans of the great revolt that had occurred in Equestria. They were even bringing their new, modern tanks, and their support staff. Rosin had scraped together the time to watch them arrive, and was enamored by their Fatherland-made equipment, increasingly rare in his own region. Yet when he took his eyes away from the heavy weapons, he saw a strange bitterness in the eyes of these soldiers, nearly to the last.\n\nHis posting was hardly the most romantic, safe, or personally-enriching, but they would be helping to build the perfect state for their kind.

He asked for the fifth time that day.\n\nThe pony, one of many to be brought into the government through the emigration program, had once been nervous, but now he understood. "Yes. Now, looking at all the equipment, I can't recommend you use such a weapon. Even when you personally ignore the ethical issues, all this tech wasn't well-maintained, and worse, there are gaps in our notes and we can't tell which is because they were lost and which is because these were stolen from Equestria." He flipped the papers on the clipboard in front of him. "We can probably make a functional bomb, with some trials... but it won't be clean."\n\n"What do you mean by 'clean'?" Rosin asked. "We have plenty of spare land to get rid of waste in."\n\n"I mean that these bombs are theorized to leave a lot of toxic material behind since that's how they explode." The scientist explained. "And ours won't be efficient, so they might leave a lot of it. Detonate one of these bombs, and where it went off might be totally uninhabitable for decades."\n\n"That's fine." Rosin thought out loud. They didn't need to use it. If they had it, the message was clear enough about what would happen to any who resisted the new order. "How long until we get it?"\n\n"Uh... it should be done in a month or two." The scientist guessed. "Stalliongrad was building their own, so we already have most of a facility, once we clean the rust off and get everything running again. This stuff you found is most of what was missing."

Normally, a dedicated commission would have been used, but creating Stalliongrad's new history was too massive a task for it to be done by a few changelings. Instead, it would be gathered from many changelings in their spare time, and the commission would simply be weaving together the replacement story into something publishable.\n\nSure, most of the suggestions were outright and obvious lies, but that didn't matter. In a few years, after it was the only story they had been told except for the equally-false nonsense that the partisans tended to believe, the ponies would come around to the new way of thinking. In the Palace's basement was where the truth would reside. There, and in the memories of creatures like Rosin, who had helped Stalliongrad die.\n\nWhen the ponies knew the new history, they would know the new world, and the nation would be that much closer to being the perfect place for his race to grow and thrive."

They've been turning in rebels whenever they crop up, and there hasn't been any partisan activity at all." As Rosin looked around at the village, he saw ponies going about their lives normally like they had been ordered to, and saw a sign of peace.\n\nIt was short-lived. There were the sounds of a struggle behind him, and when he turned around, he saw his guards pinning down an oddly-dressed pony. She was wearing a mixture of military equipment from both the Red Army and the Vhy, while her clothes turned out to be rough work clothes dyed into earthen colors. Jenom began screaming for her death, but Rosin glared at him and the message was sent. "You're not a partisan, are you?" Rosin asked, stooping down to get closer to the pony's ground-based eye level.\n\n"No." The pony replied, strained under the weight of two changelings.\n\n"Then what are you?" He asked further.\n\n"Isn't it obvious? I'm a stalker." She declared as best as she could. Rosin motioned for the guards to let her stand up, and after shaking the biggest pieces of dirt off, she continued. "The last couple decades have been a parade of our fellow northerners hiding their wealth before flying or dying. Folks like me are tracking it down."\n\n"And the guns?" Rosin asked.

Sadly, I am very busy, and cannot stay long, but rest assured that my primary goal will be to get you and those who come after you comfortable and prosperous in this new land."

What kind of changeling desired to live there, given the choice between another culture's pride and another culture's failed imitation? It would not do for the new changeling state.\n\nOne order later, and he could see it from his office. Trucks came and dropped off material at the Palace, which was now to be the spire of a hive, built inorganically in massive concrete segments until as much of the downtown area as possible was a densely-packed megastructure of stone on top of stone on top of packed ground on top of tunnels. It would not be large by hive standards, but it would be the most modern one yet. Everything from shops and apartments to heavy foundries, all in a fraction the area of the city it was replacing.\n\nThe Prandialists had agreed to allow his forces to singularly occupy the center of town for this project. From their perspective, it was a few acres of land that was overhunted anyways, and their own more traditional hive structure was far enough away to not interrupt. They had agreed amongst themselves that the Vhy had taken charge under their own power, and they were nearly tolerable now.\n\nRosin had never been an architect, but he could appreciate monumentality.

Taking it off was something he usually did once per day, less in certain crisis situations. Once it was off, he would eat whatever his servants had prepared. He was too old to survive on junk food, and to get every minute of sleep he could, he ate so quickly that he scarcely tasted what he was actually putting inside him, so it was usually healthy but tasteless or worse. Then he would go straight to bed. In the morning he would have another meal that he didn't get any enjoyment from, put on an identical coat, and go straight back to the Palace.\n\nIt wasn't the worst living he'd ever had. His time in Griffonia had had some periods that were worse. Those had lasted weeks at most, however.\n\nIt struck him as very odd on this night that he didn't want to sleep, although he was in bed. He wanted to stay up and listen to Solargrad's first officially-released album, which was sitting on the dressed by the phonograph. He had been to the live performance last week, and many of the songs cried out to be listened to again. But he hardly got enough sleep as-is, how could he spend precious night hours listening to music?\n\nA number of other high officers were at that performance, and had received their own albums. Having some sort of media to bond with them over would make him a lot more palatable, he figured.

severyana_a.39.d:0 "Despite its former status as a luxury vehicle, the back seat of the car was uncomfortable, thanks in no small part to Rosin's hosts. As a sign of diplomacy and goodwill, he had agreed to visit Ichorograd and see what the Prandialists had made, and he was wishing he hadn't. His chauffeurs were Octy and Urbiates, and he suspected that they were intentionally driving through the most threatening part of town possible, using a record player to blast music that was at once distant and alien, and aggressive and forceful. Even when he was trying to be friendly, they wouldn't let him forget the hate they had for him.\n\nThe car passed by another cluster of corpses of ponies impaled on sharpened rebar stuck into the sidewalk. "REACTIONARY", said the sign around one's neck. "THIEF", said another. A third was besides a dead changeling, who was labelled "ZOOPHILE". The crimes were different, but there had been at least a dozen clusters he'd seen on the way in.\n\nIchorograd was short for a hive, which meant that it snuck up on Rosin, only barely taller than the buildings around it despite it being a sheer wall of stone. "Here we are," Urbiates said. The gates to the city were large and currently symbolic, being a large opening rather than a door. Hanging from the frame were bundles of severed heads, some withered to skulls and others looking like they were fresh. "Welcome to Ichorograd, comrade budski," he continued in a mocking tone. "I hope you enjoy the tour.""

severyana_a.40.d:0 "Ichorograd was a massive structure, built faster than any before it through the collective efforts of over two hundred thousand part-time workers. In spite of that, it was barbaric in every way. Large sections seemed either entirely unplanned or built to be properly designed later. The Severyanan and Stalliongradian architecture was not integrated into the superstructure as much as it was absorbed by it, causing architectural styles to clash monstrously. The pre-existing roads didn't center on the hive itself, so the entire place was difficult to navigate unaided. It was like a parody of a hive.\n\nMost harrowing, in the place of cafeterias or restaurants, there were simply craters dug into the asphalt where ponies, many still alive and unharmed, were thrown to be consumed communally. The tour was punctuated by screams or cries or stray pools of blood as the denizens played with their food.\n\nRosin felt no shame in his sympathy. The ponies were lower creatures, but this was too far, he was sure of it. He didn't dare say it for risk of offending his hosts. Even if they were trying to make him miserable, he needed them to at least think he tried to be a good sport.\n\nThe last stop was dead center of the megastructure, and Rosin couldn't believe his eyes. Stacked at least two stories tall was a monument built out of the discarded skulls of whatever the Prandialists could catch. At the top was a throne made out of ribs and spines. "Who is it for?" Rosin asked.\n\nSmirking, Urbiates simply answered, "Princess Celestia."\n\n"Why did you build this?"\n\n"Come on, Rosin. Don't tell me you don't feel their power coursing through this hive. We have their skulls, we have their souls, great and pathetic alike, all chained to the will of our hive." Urbiates explained. "It's a fine spin on an ancient tradition, one which your precious Chrysalis tried to stamp out."\n\n"Ah", Rosin grunted."

"They must be going at it quite aggressively," he thought, "for me to hear it happening from thirteen stories up."\n\nIt was June 25th, and that meant it was Second Hearthswarming, a curious holiday within Prandialist circles. Created to celebrate something or maybe because it seemed like a good idea at the time, it was the thematic opposite of the Equestrian Hearthswarming celebrations, with politically-active changelings going door to door with weapons and large sacks and demanding your valuables.\n\nLegally, you were supposed to resist. Practically, no one did, and the Vhy or police forces tracked down participants to kill them and wound up keeping much of the loot for themselves. It was a strange back-and-forth. From the rising pillars of smoke and the screams, the native ponies had not quite grasped it. Rosin hadn't either, at first.\n\n"Hey, someone broke into my office and stole my fine vodka." Jenom whined as he barged into the room. Rosin noted the lack of a "Herr Kommandant" before or after than sentence.\n\n"How terrible." He replied, still staring at the cloudy sky, increasingly black with soot. "Without your booze, you might accidentally do your job."

Replied a grating, tinny voice who's obnoxious candor could only have come from Urbiates. "I can't believe I'm saying this, but we need smart people who read books right about now and that's you."\n\nRosin leaned forwards, even though he was alone in his office. "There's many kinds of 'book-readers', what's the kind you're asking for?"\n\n"Okay, so we ran the numbers, and we don't have enough horses to eat." Urbiates explained. Then he stopped.\n\n"Then kill more," Rosin said.\n\n"No, we'll run out if we do that. What we need is some way to mechanically extract more love from each pony so that they turn into progressive generators rather than something we harvest once." Urbiates explained. "And yes, smart-ass, I did read that off of a card. Can you help us build these machines or not?"\n\nRosin tapped his chin with a pen. "I have a hard time believing you read that off of anything. But to answer your question, we can. We've been supporting a smaller population through fishing, so we've had no need to, but I seem to recall that we have some designs laying around. How many do you need?"\n\n"As many as you can supply."\n\n"And what do we get in return?"\n\n"I don't know how many of our factory farms we can afford if we have to keep building massive ones to get some utility." There was silence on the line for a few seconds before Urbiates could think how to continue. "So what you get is, we don't run out of food in ten years and come into your territory to take yours."

He was coming as a conqueror, although few locals knew it, and those who did couldn't put it into words. High on a stage made of rubble and scrap metal, Urbiates sat on a pillaged recliner, ready for the argument to come.\n\nAssembled before him were thousands, no, tens of thousands of changelings, each a pair of eyes looking expectedly. Around him were more thousands, nearly surrounding the platform. He straightened the collar on his jacket. "I shall be brief." He opened, his voice given as much power as he could muster to fill the room. "My name is Rosin Lyctia, and I desire not your cooperation, but your sublimation. I believe that it is now clear to you, as it is to me, that the last few years have tested your politics, and found it wanting. You have watched your fellows sit idle, while me and my organization has used its technology and its structure to react to issues that affect both of us."\n\n"Hey now, that's not fair. We have done much to prepare for the future." Urbiates interjected. "Yeah, you've got some advantages, but we have some too, and we're still capable of surviving just fine on our side of the country. I don't think that taking over our cultures is necessary for our survival."\n\n"Isn't it?" Rosin questioned. "The situation continues to deteriorate as fast as we can reconstruct it in our own domains. Rebels plague the countryside, nowhere is safe, and yet your own disparate sub-hives squabble about details instead of acting."\n\nRosin looked at the crowd. He could see it in their eyes. They knew they were surviving, but his own forces were DOING. Urbiates missed it. "Alright, everyone, we've fought for a century for this land. Do you really want to give up now?

Rosin replied, staring vacantly into a bright future. "I'm thinking we should start by banning non-kin-centric relationships. Yes." He went back to sitting properly in his chair and began drafting the new legislation.\n\n"I mean, most relationships only involve two parties." Jenom butted in. "That's not really enough for it to be circular, much less nonconcentric. Isn't polygamy already banned?"\n\n"He said 'non-consensual'. Which I also thought was already banned, but better late than never I guess." Mekansti explained.\n\n"No, I said 'non-kin-centric'. You know, like how homosexual couples cannot produce offspring." Rosin said casually as he focused on the paper.\n\n"Wait, you're banning homosexuality?" Meknasti asked. Rosin nodded that he was. Meknasti looked to Jenom, who was also confused. Then he looked back into the focused face of Kommandant Rosin. "...Why?"\n\nRosin looked up at them. "Because it's wasteful and anti-traditional, and plus, homosexuals are responsible for much of the degeneracy of Changeling society. For example, Thorax was a homosexual, or at least the papers said so... It's all in Dieter's books, you know. You have read them, right?"\n\nMeknasti looked around the room frantically.

I was just here to discuss trends in partisan activity with some of your lieutenants. Some are quite concerning, and my organization would like some light armored vehicles."\n\n"Well, good luck with your discussion. I am going to ban homosexuality."

Rosin wondered if there was some psychologist who could tell between quirks that are learned and ones that are inherent to the species as he saw it. "...Why?" She asked.

Even the grand entryway had its tile floors shattered so that a chain-link fence could run through it, separating the Prandialist half from the Vhy half. Rosin remembered when he discovered that the map was drawn to have this building be co-owned. He had wondered if it was some sort of ploy to get the two groups to work together, but now he thought it was simply one of her bad ideas, like that he was sent here at all.\n\nHe was annoyed. It wasn't that he disliked how Tarea didn't want to be cooped-up all the time.

Rosin wasn't sure what that guy was expecting to happen, but until he found a new guard, he felt it was necessary to accompany her himself. The city was still very, very dangerous.\n\nAs they walked to the Eastern side of the front doors (the Western side was the Prandialist one), Tarea turned her head to follow a changeling who was dragging a pony to the interrogation room. "Is he supposed to be disguised?" She asked. Rosin stamped his hoof with the force of a gunshot. The guard stopped, noticed that the Kommandant was glaring, and came over. "You shouldn't play around, you know." Tarea offered to the roughed-up pony in Changelingish.\n\nNow that was funny. By now, a Prandialist would have dropped the act and demanded to be let go.

The real reason was that, if it was the VOPS, they knew that Jenom was secretly Rosin's sole designated successor, and that the entire protectorate would collapse within the week if they were both killed.

We're thinking about building factory farm structures for the ponies to achieve long-term food sustainability, that kind of sh*t. Anyways, it would be a lot easier if we could just go out and grab as much food as we need, but there's not enough ponies on our side of the country. So I guess the long story short is, if we, say, pushed that motion forwards, would you let us borrow your populace? We'd make it worth your while."\n\nSupposedly, this would have major ramifications for the future of the Protectorate. Rosin knew better. They'd already made their choice and his answere was a part of a bet or something. Well, he'd already come this far. He flipped a coin on his desk."

He took a moment to inhale the crisp air, and the burnt metal and the argon shielding gas it carried. He enjoyed it. "Yes, Herr Maxilla, I am quite satisfied with your work here." He dispassionately said, partially so that he wouldn't reveal how little he understood about naval engineering and warfare. Maxilla already knew, but it never helped to revel in incompetence.\n\nThe meeting adjourned, he was waved off at the curb. He climbed into the back of his limousine, where Jenom was squeezed in with other two guards, the latter armed with assault rifles. "Do the ships still float?" Jenom asked sarcastically, his head at a severe angle and still pressed against the roof.\n\n"Arguably." Rosin deadpanned back. Jenom blinked, and Rosin instantly regretted trying to be subtle. "Just tell the driver to take us back to the Palace."\n\nThe long car shuddered and the buildings outside began to move away. Rosin watched as Petershoof passed him by, seeing how many buildings were still boarded up, or dilapidated, or ruins from the war or some antipartisan activity. Ichorograd was quiet now that nearly all the ponies had been consumed by the Prandialists, but even there gun battles still broke out. He sighed to himself. Would he ever be allowed to go home? By now, he felt that, if he left, this nation would entirely collapse, and he would not feel the slightest guilt except for that such a disaster would cause refugees and terrorists to flood into the Hegemony.\n\n"Missing home?"Jenom asked.\n\nRosin nodded.\n\n"Yeah, we all do. But they don't call it the 'Severyana Exclusion Zone' for nothing." He commented.\n\n"It's the Severyana Protectorate. We should ban them referring to it as such. And referring to the Changeling Hegemony as the 'Union of Ruinous States'." Rosin mumbled."

A few years into the famine, they heroically redesignated the corn fields as hay fields and packaged the weeds that had grown up as hay for the poor."\n\n"Why are you telling me this?" Jenom asked.\n\n"I think it's interesting. In Griffonia, I saw plenty of businesses give their defects to charity. In Equestria they usually just throw the mistakes out to avoid giving someone a bad product, but not here. Our own siblings are so precise that they rarely make mistakes to begin with." He mused. The vehicle slowly rolled to a stop. "National unity certainly casts a thick shadow for an apparition, doesn't it? Hey, what's going on?"\n\nThe driver was in an argument up front. Some pony security guards were annoyed with him over something. One came around back and Rosin saw a patch of the Severyana Highway Police on his arm. The pony banged the butt of his rifle on the door and loudly shouted, "Come on, how much do you have in here?" the window rolled down to reveal Rosin with a gun pointing at the offender.

The Palace, however, remained an immovable monument to naivete in the center of Ichorograd, and it would likely remain such for a long time. He stepped out of the fine vehicle, his erstwhile guard close behind, and stared up. His break was over.\n\nInside the lobby was Tarea, overseen by her own personal guard. The stoic changeling handed Rosin a note describing the various comings and goings and which ones were disguised changelings. The majority were Prandialists, likely in the habit of being in disguise around their hated foes as some sort of evolutionary defense mechanism. Only one was unaccountable. "Good work, Tarea." He said. She bowed slightly. This was so much easier without having to kill anyone suspicious.\n\n"Do you think I will be able to go back soon?" Tarea asked right as Rosin was pulling away.\n\n"I think so. We would love to keep hosting you, but we are past the hard times." Rosin admitted. "If the royal clique asked for your return, we would have to oblige. Do you not like it here?"\n\nShe looked down, as if she were embarrassed to admit it. "I do not."\n\nRosin sighed sadly.

Rosin pushed the 13th floor button and looked expectantly as the small box shuddered and moved. "Oh, ah, okay. So, well, the lack of deuterium is going to continue to hamstring our expansion plans, forcing us to continue to use Uranium. We can't breed Plutonium or get Tritium without it, and that means no Plutonium bombs or Hydrogen bombs, which would be the next step. We've coordinated with the local bureaucracy to find a secure location for a second panning station, but that will be extra expensive." The first panning station simply filtered deuterium from the ocean but it had exploded for reasons unknown. There were no survivors. A battleship from the fatherland had been on near-shore patrol at the time and somehow hadn't seen anything useful.\n\nRosin looked at the costs and marveled at the amount of zeroes. The proposal was for a water purification plant that didn't purify water, but still. "I think we'll pass on the expansion. The presence of N-bombs is the most important part of the program, so simple uranium weapons are enough. Thank you for the update."\n\nThe elevator doors opened.

Rosin himself was an academic, but he had been an officer at various points and levels over the last three decades, and he did not feel like having sat in the trenches made him better at the intensive probability modeling and personnel management that came with higher command posts. Not all merit came from struggle.\n\n"Herr Kommandant, our Economic Bureau has the latest projections. At the current rate, we will be the first government to print its own money and still go bankrupt, as there is a degenerating paper shortage preventing us from minting new bills."\n\n"That's bad." Rosin said.\n\n"Yes." The bureaucrat stated assuredly before standing still. He stared at Rosin. Rosin stared back.\n\n"So we're dirt poor. I know. Are you going to tell me anything useful?" Rosin interrogated.\n\n"No, that's basically it for the report."\n\nRosin pointed back where the changeling had come from. "Get the hell out of my face if you don't have anything useful to say."

"I would like to lodge a complaint. I recently applied for a business license, but I was denied by someone from your office!" She is clearly enraged by this insult.\n\nRosin looked at her askance as he tried to figure out the best way to get quickly out of this conversation. "Was it a bad business idea?" He asked.\n\n"No! It's a great idea! Do you know how many jazz clubs there are in this country? How many different, specialty products they need, the markup I can sell them for? And I can't make them! The General Secretary of National Business said, to my face, that it was because of my species."\n\nRosin understood what was happening now. Jazz clubs were degenerate Zebra trash and the number in the country was supposed to be a number between 1 and -1. But most creatures didn't get it.

Instead, he saw the same decaying city that was his current nation.\n\nThere was a knock at the door. He had been enraptured by his nostalgia for a few minutes. "Come in," he called. A mare dressed as a servant entered and nervously left him a cup of tea without saying a word. He idly waved her away and took it. The tea in this country was always poor, but the coffee was like mud, so he preferred the former. Yet there was something different about this cup, the taste was... The servant hadn't left yet, and he called out to her. She turned sharply and terror filled her eyes. In perfect Severyanan, he said, "This has glowdust in it, right? I don't know where you got it, but it's been years since I felt like I was home." He sighed contentedly. "It's just what I needed right now. Thank you." He let himself relax. This wasn't all-bad. Half-bad or worse, but not all-bad.\n\nThe mare looked at the smiling officer and tried to smile back, but she was still petrified with fear, and she left in a hurry. Once she was a distance away, she laughed to herself from the stress, but also from the absurdity of it. Her plan had been foolproof, and executed without flaw.

He leaned over and picked up his shovel, wiping off the edges before folding it up and putting it back on his belt, then went back to sitting in his chair.

I think it's bolted to the floor." Urbiates asked.\n\n"Of course not." Octy replied. "It just needs some convincing."\n\n"No, I mean-" Urbiates was interrupted by the sound of the jackhammer starting up and being pressed against the base of the chair.

Beyond that, the details were still being worked out.\n\nThe sole problem was that, at the moment, it was approximately five changelings in construction helmets and a cool drawing on a chalkboard, although that was getting filled up with names and soon the suggestions would be encroaching on the design.\n\nUrbiates stood on the roof of a city tram, the cabin itself stuffed with nearly a dozen corpses of hacked-apart ponies. A crowd of thousands of changelings surrounded the vehicle. The first vote of the day had been to hold off on eating until a name was chosen, and it had passed. Everyone was regretting that now, four hours later. "Alright, clearly you all don't like any name, and I want to eat!" He shouted. "So how about you take the list of suggestions we have now, and decide your favorite, and shout it out when I do if you support it!" He checked the list of names on the board sitting besides him. "Subterrananononphotopolis!" A few cheers went out. "Terrafluvimonsflorabellatopia!" One girl shouted from the back. "Cerebrasophocognimelantragiopia?" Around a dozen cries rang in the street.

"Topic of the day! As you can see, we've been doing just fine for food, but Ichorograd's pre-existing population is not unlimited. I've heard that we should start adding wings to the structure specifically for factory-farming and I think in the long-run that would be quite sustainable." A murmur rose from the crowd. They liked the way things were now, where hunting parties simply left the hive and dragged back as much meat as they wanted. "Now, I know this is no fun, so I asked a friend to do some math." He continued.\n\nA changeling in giant glasses took to the stage alongside him. "So we looked at the data," he unassuredly explained, "And things are going to be tight if we rely exclusively on hunting. One bad season could leave us overharvesting, and then we'd be in a death spiral with no recourse." The murmur in the crowd continued, but had turned from offense to worry. "The only way out of it would be to start poaching the Vhy's section of the country, and that would, naturally, invite issues."\n\nThe stage had a phone so that politically-active changelings could call in without having to be physically in the hive.

You were there at the vote." Urbiates replied, staring out the window at the trees passing by.\n\n"No, I was drunk at the time." Octy explained. "But I was more asking why we get some stuff by plane and nearly everything else by that tunnel up north, the one that goes into the Crystal Empire."\n\nUrbiates leaned up. "Oh, yeah, that. Well, with the ban on anything entering or leaving the country without special permission, we have to be careful to not get caught. So no putting too much stuff through there. Honestly, what we get is already pretty minor because we get so little of it."\n\n"That seems like an oversight. We should invade the old country to fix that." Octy said idly.\n\n"One day we will, comrade budski." Urbiates lazily replied. "Although I do wonder. We're mostly bringing in replacement parts for machinery, and technical documentation. We could probably get more use out of it if we went all-in on one of those. Think we should bring that up to the forum when we get back?"\n\n"Probably," Octy answered. "Which one do you think is better, though?"\n\n"I don't know." Urbiates admitted. He turned to the pony tied up in the backseat. "You have any ideas?" He asked in Severyanan.\n\nThe pony looked between them. "I have no idea what either of you have been saying, so I guess my answer is option number two."\n\nOcty threw up one of his arms.

We show up and point out the revisionism of the system, and it all vanishes and you're on the radio talking about how we're all monsters. What happened?"\n\nThe mare angrily yelled, "You're not fighting revisionism, you're just illiterate!"\n\n"You got an example of that, chum?" Urbiates asked, chuckling. "You think we're too democratic? Too hard-working? Too revolutionary? Too equal?"\n\n"Too Equal? You're a cargo cult!" She complained. "You worship mountains and rocks and shrines to someone named Prandia and if you'd actually read the books you profess to love you'd know that religion is the opiate of the masses!"\n\nOcty leaned over to Urbiates and loudly whispered, "Wow, look at this revisionism."\n\nUrbiates adjusted his hat dramatically and replied, "This sure is an advanced case." By now they were standing right in front of the door, near where the fence separating the Prandialist and Vhy sides of the city entered the building. "Alright, then. Have you considered the importance of using democratic syndicalism to revolutionize the productive forces and de-react to the fascist bourgeoisie so that the division of labor can socialize the proletariat?" The mare stared at him, her mouth agape. "I see you haven't." Urbiates continued, pleased with himself.\n\n"What's there to consider? That was just a load of words that leftists use!" She protested as Urbiates and Octy put on plastic goggles.\n\nThere was an ear-splitting crush as the great statue of the false Marks hit the pavement, twisting into a vague shape and covering the duo in the remains of the revolutionary it had landed on."

Now he had to sit here, disguised, sharing a train ride with ponies trying to leave St. Petershoof and flee to the rural farms. A pony who was Octy tugged at his shoulder. "Hey, Urbiates." He whispered. "Check out small-and-short over there." Sure enough, a tiny pony across the car had brought out a guitar and was playing for a growing crowd. It was typical pony caterwaul, the lyrics describing a sniper from the war who had supposedly killed hundreds of changelings. It was bold to play such a song in a changeling country, doubly so since the singer was a one-pint wonder.\n\nAs the musician finished and started to extoll the Red Army's virtues further, Urbiates couldn't help but laugh. "What the hell's so funny, huh?" The scale model asked in a thick Equestrian accent when he heard it.\n\n"Sorry, buddy, never seen a statuette that sang before. Haven't seen a patriot with such delicate hooves since before the war, either. What was your service?" Urbiates joked.\n\n"Equestrian Navy, two years." The singer proudly replied.\n\nUrbiates faked surprise. "Oh, really? Did a PT boat lose its standard-issue meterstick?"\n\n"Well, if it's really that important, I was a CS aboard the CH ship Peace and Love." Their little pony retorted angrily.\n\nIt was Octy's turn to laugh. "CS on a CH? You weren't in the navy, you were a dishwasher in the Merchant Marine!"\n\nThe singer's face twisted. "Wh- Shut the hell up! Shut up! What the hell did you do, huh?"\n\nIn between bursts of chuckling, Urbiates managed to get out, "More than you, six-string-ukelele!"\n\nThe car was unentertained, but Urbiates and Octy were laughing as the train pulled into station."

"We lost our country, we lost our government, and now the damn bugs are running all over the place, killing whoever they feel like. Everyone needs high spirits, don't you think?"\n\nUrbiates looked at him. "Yeah, dealing with you would be easier if I was high and had some spirits. Anyways, stop pretending you're from here, you're so Equestrian that I smell apple cider just by looking at you."\n\nHe turned back to leave, but the singer kept going. "Like it or not, I'm in the same boat as you all. I came here by choice, and now I can't leave. We're all workers, right?"\n\nUrbiates thought for a second, and turned to Octy. His buggy friend whispered something into his ear. Guess Urbiates wasn't getting to Ichorograd without a problem.\n\n"Alright, comrade budski." Urbiates turned. "Let me tell you something. I've met that markspony you were singing about. She was in three pieces at the time, but it was nothing a bit of ketchup couldn't fix."\n\nThe singer had had a surprised expression when he said the first part, but then it became horrified. "Wait, what?"\n\n"Yup. Gave her skull to one of our own as a gift." He let his disguise drop now that nobody was nearby, revealing his full form. Urbiates was large by changeling standards, about the size of an average pony. And the musician was smaller than most changelings. Fear filled his small eyes as he realized the monster towered over him. As he advanced, Octy yelled out from behind, "Let's see if that machine you're carrying really does kill supremacists!""

Urbiates tried to joke back as Octy trailed in behind him with his new guitar in tow.\n\nRosin ignored it and began talking. "So I've got to have you talk to your hivemates about who you target and why. We have a plan to coerce and replace key celebrities to make them look like they're supporting our government, but it won't work if your thugs kill anyone you recognize and then plaster their face all over every building."\n\nUrbiates stretched his legs now that he was able to sit down. "Not sure that's worth the effort, you know how much we like killing."\n\nUnphased, Rosin continued. "If all it does is spread mistrust, that's fine. But we have some ideal targets. Woody Chipper, for example. He may have the physique of a stick bug, but he has the spine of one, too. We could definitely press him into being a propagandist for us if we grab him. But he also has a propensity for saying things he shouldn't, so even if you don't know who he is, one of you lot would probably kill him just because." Then he caught sight of the performer's guitar around Octy's torso and made a face.\n\n"If he's a musician who could moonlight as a garden gnome, then I have some bad news about him in particular." Urbiates hazarded.\n\nClearly it was. "Whatever, are you going to cooperate or not?" Rosin muttered."

He stared at the pavement. "I'd like to help, but I think I'll wait," he managed to force out before falling asleep on the pavement.\n\nUrbiates wasn't sure whether he was more upset by the fact that his fellow Prandialists had regressed back to the monarchy, or that he had apparently agreed to dealing with it. The structure before him was yet another under-construction hive, with a few rough-hewn guards standing around. They waved to him cheerily, but he couldn't help feel unsettled. What would it even mean that a monarch was elected? As he passed the car, he considered taking the piece of wreckage from the grill and using it as a weapon, but he wasn't sure who his enemy was.\n\nHives had rarely been constructed, but in Severyana he was getting used to the sight of dirt and stone walls connecting buildings into one superstructure. On any other day, his guide excitedly telling him about every nook and cranny would have been fun, but he was still reeling. At the center was the old governor's building, which was formerly a palace and distinctly hadn't had its luxury stripped in the years since. That was where he found himself.\n\nThe pedestals where degenerate Equine artworks had been remained, as with the bright carpets and gold trims, as he took the stairs up to the main office. When his guide opened the door without pomp or circumstance, he wondered whether the reports of a monarch were true, but sure enough, behind the governor's desk was a throne, and it was occupied."

The frontier." She replied. "We had to systematize collections. Negotiations. Resources.

"At some point, we decided that everything needed to be centralized. I had been organizing things one after the other, and they, well, decided it should be my job and mine alone."\n\nUrbiates frowned. "Aren't you bringing back the monarchy, and all the problems it entails? You're a single point of failure now, and have an interest in remaining special."\n\n"Come on, Urbiates." She rolled her eyes. "There's always one point of failure. The question is how large that community is. You know that groups wax and wane like dynasties and individuals. You also have a high status because of your own popularity, but you don't see an issue with that."\n\nUrbiates retorted. "I do, actually. I don't like how many changelings let me think for them. But I guess I can't stop them, either. But that's not all. You're taking the power from the common changeling to vest it in yourself, and the common changeling is the ultimate good, not you."\n\nLooking back at him, she replied, "'To be a monarch is to be above another'. Prandia herself said that. Our traditional rulers wanted to be the only monarch, but I don't dispute the right for the common changeling to stand above the lesser races.

"If you want an autograph, you need to talk to Octy, he's the one who knows how to sign my name."\n\n"You are one tadpole in an ocean. I don't want your autograph. I want to discuss business."

"I admire your craft and am willing to give you incredible power to use as you see fit - if you would only change your priorities a little."\n\nUrbiates rubbed his eyes, thinking that maybe it was worth hearing out. He turned and gasped at what he saw. It looked like a Griffon that had been left dead for a week, decrepit grey rags of skin and fur and feathers barely clinging to its often-exposed skeleton. Its face was half skull and half patches of decomposed flesh. "YOU LOOK DIFFERENT FROM ME!" Urbiates screamed, reaching for a chair. "I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!"\n\n"You buffoon!" The apparition yelled back as the seat smashed against its head, knocking it to the floor. "Stop fighting me, I'm already barely holding on!"\n\n"KILL KILL KILL KILL AAAAAAH!"

Octy asked as he began to cut, eliciting a thick gurgling noise.\n\n"Something like that," the director said as every member of the crew leaned in to get a better shot.

I feel like a damn herder out here, it's so quiet." The "owner" of the house replied. She had come out here with nearly a dozen friends, like many others, to expel everyone from a house in this sleepy town for themselves. The purpose was to create a first line of defense away from the growing settlements. She and her crew would watch this village, use the tunnels they'd dug around to hide their movements, pretend to be random villagers or just the ones they'd supplanted who were still wandering around. If bad guys came, they could use those same tunnels to flee and warn the bigger groups. They weren't likely to, though, since everybody here knew the changelings were watching, just not when or how. They also knew that the changelings were watching for a sign as much as for an excuse.\n\nUrbiates stepped back from the window. "You can't win them all," he accepted, his voice modulated by his disguise. "See anything interesting?"\n\n"No, but we did get one of the former tenants beaten to death. He broke into someone's house to steal food and they thought he was one of us." The homeowner explained. "That was pretty funny. Also, there's a killer on the loose.

He could see the industrial district, the tall apartment buildings, the office he never used on the 5th floor of the Palace and Rosin's office on the 13th. He could just about see the wind as it blew through his clothes and across his face.\n\nThe hive was going to be shorter and wider than most, planted forcefully into the cityscape. The roof would be mostly flat until it curved up to a short spire in the middle, while the walls would be at a steep angle, but it was still tens of meters at its shortest. Far below, he could also see the construction equipment tearing up dirt to make the rammed earth walls that would be multiple stories tall. He could see the pits, the demolished buildings, the skyways for the buildings that had simply been absorbed, and the utility work going on to make the structure support a population the size of the rest of the city's in less than one-tenth the space.\n\nIt would be unthinkable for the small mind of a pony, but normal for a changeling.\n\nAs Urbiates looked out across the massive construction taking place, he felt a little bit of pride. This was not his victory, but one of the whole changeling race, and yet he had done his part to help. He'd dictated so many articles for political magazines, and also killed a LOT of creatures, so this was partially, moderately, ever-so-slightly his doing as well.\n\n"Well, comrade budski, I think we have it made now."

severyana_b.25.d:0 "Zayatsk's Factory 1618 had produced heavy vehicles. Once this meant tractors, but during the war it turned to making war machines. After weeks of trekking across the Severyanan mud and ice, watching the Panzergrenadiers drive by unimpeded in their half-tracks, Urbiates had gotten the opportunity to try some of the metal beasts out. It was awful! The engines needed a hammer and two priests to start, and then they would break after four hours, and the armored car had caught fire from trying to climb a hill, and he nearly had a chitin crack from trying to go off-road, and it was bad, and who would ever drive one of these f*cking things?! Just hop on a direwolf if you're tired of walking, you stupid ponies!\n\nThat aside, the factory itself was nice, even before a few thousand settlers started changeling-ifying it. Plenty of interior and underground space, built like a fortress, a pleasant scent of wet metal... And more settlers were coming to make sure production restarted in earnest, and the locals didn't complain.\n\n"The place certainly cleans up well, Ann." Urbiates commented to Anastasia.\n\n"Even I'm shocked by it. There was an issue with some squatters attacking us when we tried to come down here, but we defended ourselves." She replied, sighing with satisfaction. This particular settlement was her idea, although many other large population centers were gaining similar encampments. "I do want to run something by you, though. There's a lot of big open areas that would be good for animal pens. That would kind of keep us from using the factory as intended, but we could do some really good work if we had a lot more direwolves, archvultures, whatever. It would be a lot easier to keep the ponies from putting us in self-defense situations."\n\nUrbiates was taken aback. "Wow, that's a pretty good idea. Huh.""

severyana_b.26.d:0 ""Dance to the beat, wave your hooves together! Come feel the heat, forever and forever!" Urbiates and Octy sang together. The former turned to the back of the car and saw Rosin retreating into his coat the way a turtle retreats into its shell. It had been his idea to be seen hanging out with him for a day to make it look like both groups didn't totally hate each other, to make it stranger.\n\nIt was a shame that, to make it through this national adventure, they did have to work with those pricks. For now.\n\nThe car arrived at the grand front entrance of Ichorograd after Octy found a way to hide that he was looking at a map and they stopped being lost. "Here we are," Urbiates said to Rosin. "Welcome to Ichorograd, comrade budski."\n\nHe was nearly silent throughout the tour. He made some polite small talk, but never adjusted to the charnel pits, the abattoirs, the public forums, the ossuaries, and the other infrastructure and amenities of Ichorograd. Then again, authentic changeling culture wasn't his thing. Not really.\n\nThe changelings of Ichorograd had been saving skulls of partisans, officers, governors, anyone of note they could get, and they had built a grand totem in the center of the hive in its greatest hall, and it was the tour's finale. In days past, many changeling households had owned the skulls of defeated foreigners, but now it was all held in common. Rosin seemed startled by the sight, and pointed to the top, where the spire ended in a chair of bones. "Who is it for?" He asked.\n\n"Princess Celestia," Urbiates replied proudly.\n\nRosin seemed confused by the answer. "Why did you build this?"\n\n"Come on, Rosin. Don't tell me you don't feel their power coursing through this hive. We have their skulls, we have their souls, great and pathetic alike, all chained to the will of our hive." Urbiates explained. "It's a fine spin on an ancient tradition, one which your precious Chrysalis tried to stamp out."\n\nRosin cocked his head. "Ah.""

Urbiates shouted with dramatic flourish. The pony theater-goers were visibly confused, but as they noticed the armed guards now blocking the doors, they began to sit still and hope that this was a waste-of-time interruption and not the somewhat less common waste-of-life version. "On this very day over one hundred years ago, as legend has it, Prandia herself had only two followers. But she was beginning to build her movement, and started by entering into one of the royal family's estates and leaving with everything valuable. In memory of that important day, every July 25th, we celebrate Second Hearthswarming!"\n\n"First!" Some pony in the audience yelled. The room stared at the scrawny youth off to the side. "It comes earlier in the year, so it's First Heathswarming!" He continued, realizing the attention he had drawn to himself\n\n"Listen, that's not the point!" Urbiates yelled back. He unfolded a giant sack and laid it out in front of him on the stage. "You all need to get out your sh*t and put it in this bag!"\n\n"Wait, you're robbing us!?" A mare called out from the back. Another chimed in, "Then call it 'Reverse Hearthswarming'!"\n\n"You all better shut up or there's going to be two Second Hearthswarmings!" Urbiates furiously screamed.\n\nAnd then some wise-ass (literally) stood up in the center and said it. "How about you let us keep our stuff and called it 'Second First Hearthswarming'?"\n\nUrbiates's face would have been red if his blood was that color. "That's it, kill them all!" The armed guards levelled their submachine guns and began to fire into the crowd, filling the room with smoke and blood and screams.\n\nThat was the fifth time today."

severyana_b.31.d:0 ""The Boffin" was a curious changeling. He had normal eyesight, but wore thick glasses who's lenses did nothing. He was a statistician, but wore a lab coat as if he ever worked with material of any sort. While he had once spoken with the same candor as everyone around him, he had since taken on a distinct tone of voice, one which loved big words and hated uncertain language. These were all habits he had picked up recently. What wasn't a new habit was his social awkwardness, which had always been in the background when he talked.\n\nHe was the smartest changeling Urbiates knew when it came to logic, and looking like a scientist from a badly-written movie was how that was conveyed to the changelings who did NOT know him. Also Urbiates had long forgotten his real name.\n\n"So we ran the numbers, and if we want this country to be sustainable over the long-term, we need to expand our food supplies sooner rather than later. There's nearly a million of us, more if you count those blackshirts. We were theoretically on-track, but love efficiency is below expectations." The Boffin explained. "Turns out that factory farm environments aren't conducive to love generation."\n\nUrbiates cursed under his breath. "We should have expected them to screw us like this, by being miserable and stuff. What can we do about it?"\n\nThe Boffin theatrically adjusted his glasses. "Well, the best way is to make the farms kinder, but that's politically untenable."\n\n"As it should be." Urbiates added.\n\n"Thus, we need to increase input, or mechanically increase efficiency." He looked nervous. "The former is quite expensive. The latter is... difficult. We can't do it. The Vhy can. Even though we outnumber them nearly 6 to 1, they have more PhD's than we do, and more engineering technology on their side of the country."\n\nUrbiates gritted his teeth. "So pay out the nose from our pockets or our pride. Which side should I argue to the forums for?"\n\n"That's up to you," The Boffin said."

severyana_b.32.d:0 "In the changeling homeland, the thrill of the hunt had withered before the dangerous wildlife and the relative ease of managing local breeds of pigs or sheep. Jaegers were hunters in spirit, but they were new. The "Hunters" who hunted animals were more like exterminators that specialized in large fauna. Now, in Severyana, massive swathes of land were being turned into game county. Changelings all over were finding their own hunting culture. Some went out with a gun and came back with the next few months of food. Others had their own methods.\n\nThe changeling standing in front of Urbiates was not wearing tweed, although he thought he was. Real bespoke hunters also did not use submachine guns. But this changeling was "Hunter Gravestone", the pseudonymous leading author in the new hunting community, and he had a concern.\n\n"You see," Hunter began in a strange cadence, "we are not managing these grounds as aggressively as we should. Overhunting means lost efficiency as populations regrow, and underhunting means the ponies gain too much cohesion and start organizing, and both are common. On top of that, our method of categorizing the fields is insufficient. These plains are good sport, but what of the woods? Tromp around there and you're liable to be shot by confused fellows or lucky partisan-skis."\n\n"What of democracy?" Urbiates asked. "This much regulation is likely to step on a lot of necks."\n\n"Pish-posh, they can democratically decide which ground is suitable for them!" Hunter yelled, and it became clear he was speaking in a bad Equestrian noble accent. "We ought to mark every field we can as protected and for sporting purposes, and let the exterminators have any pony who tries to hide in the forests or hills."\n\n"And if that isn't acceptable?" Urbiates prodded.\n\nHunter harrumphed. "Well, at the very least, we ought to create headcounts and such. At least try to convince the youths to not wipe out the whole populations at a time.""

A changeling peeked around the brick corner, looking through the scope on his rifle, and fired a shot at the department store at the end of the road. Another one stepped out from behind him, sling whirling above his head, and let the impact bomb fly. It launched into a window, causing chunks of drywall and wood and dust to explode out. "Hey, boss! Did you know that Ann has a trained bone-vulture?" Octy yelled across the street.\n\n"What, you didn't?" Urbiates yelled back, spraying down the bottom floor with his Papash-10, or however you were supposed to pronounce it.\n\n"No, I didn't even know they were trainable! But she's got it dragging bad guys out of third-story windows! I have to give the architects my compliments if they're still alive!" The large radio pack on his back buzzed, and he put the receiver to his ear. This rising was a last gasp, but wow was it a bad one. "Word is we're the closest to the city's escape route, they want us to take it over and kill anyone who runs since some of them will probably be the reactionaries!"\n\n"But we're supposed to be going to the armory to seize their means of destruction!" Urbiates yelled over the sound of a wailing rocket as it demolished an apartment a few blocks away, filling the street with choking dust. "And I was hoping to hit up the fireworks factory later!"\n\nOcty shut his eyes and coughed as the dust from the fallen building arrived in a wave. "What's at the fireworks factory?!"\n\n"Nothing, it just seems like we could have some fun there!" Urbiates replied.\n\nThe other changeling nearest to Urbiates, an acquaintance who happened to be nearby when the rising started chimed in. "We have to do something! Think!

Damn it, those political officers had managed to screw up everything AGAIN. How had he not learned that those morons were always utterly clueless about the situation on the ground? Why had he tried to listen to them one last time?\n\n"Comrade, the spirit of the workers is invincible!" "Comrade, the city is where the revolution is won!" "Comrade, they barely have armored vehicles! We can overwhelm them with numbers!" Shut the hell up, the fascist pig-dog queen couldn't beat these psychos, and all they did was fight in cities like this for decades!

They had taken a third of the city in the first hour, and had lost half that only three hours later! This was a disaster!\n\nWrapped in his own thoughts and the irrational fear that he would be found out despite having thrown away every part of his uniform and gear, he only barely comprehended that an open-topped car was driving up to him, with all six seats filled with changelings. What caught his eye was one wearing a strange outfit that he seemed to recall was from Bronzehill's communist movement. How out of place.\n\nAll six looked at him, lifted PPSh-10's from under their seats, and emptied the drum magazine into him as he stood on the sidewalk.

severyana_b.36.d:0 "The wooden door flew off its hinges as it was kicked in, and the motley crew of ex-bandits flooded onto the warehouse floor. Besides all being changelings wearing shades of brown, there was little in common. One had a rifle, another nothing but a sword. The largest figure was Urbiates, who had put his submachine gun away, and now held two burning torches aloft in his magic. He had to be careful, dropping one or even just waving them around in the wrong place could set off every firework in the building and take out everything within a hundred meters with no warning. "Are those really necessary?" One of his comrade budskis asked through a forceful whisper.\n\n"Yes, now shut up." Octy replied.\n\nThe shelves were high, but with traditional Severyanan fastidiousness around explosives, rockets and cherry bombs were arranged in loose piles, each at least 90% of the same type and at least three centimeters from any fire hazard. Urbiates held up a torch to an unreadably dirty sign, and saw that it said "NO SMOKING". Satisfied that he wasn't breaking the safety rules, he turned around and saw a pony in a dull grey greatcoat and equally grey hat. It was uncanny, most ponies would rather wear nothing at all than dress so drably, but for many years grey clothing had been the only kind legal in the changeling lands for non-military personnel, a de-facto ban on uniforms for any non-government organization to keep rebels from organizing. And because of the climate, greatcoats were popular.\n\nUrbiates didn't understand why a pony was dressed like a changeling, and he hated things he didn't understand. He threw one of the torches directly at it. The pony watched as it bounced off the tough coat leaving nothing but a black stain, and then calmly stamped it out as it rolled on the ground. "Tracking you down was tough enough, you don't need to make it harder." Urbiates's comrades ran up behind him and they realized that there wasn't one pony, but nearly a dozen."

Urbiates cautiously admitted as he pulled up a chair. "You might be the first pony to want to talk to me."\n\n"I'd like to start by apologizing for that. I'm sure you've known creatures who complain about their saddlebags but refuse to take out the rocks." The pony continued with an untraceable accent. "And in this country, the last thirty years have been the government proclaiming that holding rocks is its own reward. We believe that there's a better way, and that you can show us where to look." He smiled, and Urbiates felt a flash of something familiar, but completely out of place.\n\n"I appreciate the confidence, but I don't think the Prandialist way has a lot that a pony would find valuable." He replied, off-guard for the first time in years. What was happening?\n\nMarch waved it away. "Not you specifically. We mean the changelings in general. Your kind and the Vhy have more in common with each other than you do with the likes of us. We'd like to discuss working with you for our mutual benefit."\n\nUrbiates tentatively looked at his equally-confused compatriots and leaned over the table. "And why should we work with dinner?"\n\n"Because you have an image problem." March put his hoof down. "You look like monsters, and nobody can be bothered to change it. I'm still referring to all of your kind here, by the way. That might seem fine, but fighting is expensive, and if it never ends, you're just going to keep paying for replacements, often with more fighting. You need a way to get things by asking. You need friends."\n\n"And you're the friends?" Urbiates asked lazily.\n\n"Better." March smirked. "We're the ones who will get you the friends."\n\nUrbiates looked to his cohort again.

That just meant that nobody was here to defend the black-coated thugs as the announcers listed off every thing they hadn't done, every time they hadn't helped, every issue they hadn't been involved in. "I say it's time we stop pretending they're our friends and get rid of them!" The crowd roared again.\n\nUrbiates smiled. For years now, they had shared this country with those bootlickers, and he was tired of it. The changeling proletariat needed ever more room, and disposing of them was the next step.\n\n"Who among you wants to take the fight to them? To burn down their stupid Palace and seize their resources for ourselves?" He asked. Hooves, many carrying weapons, flew into the air and waved wildly. "Then it's decided! Tomorrow, we finish taking our country!"\n\nMany would die, but death was a small setback for a race as great as the changelings. Urbiates smiled broader. The utopia was on the horizon."

Then they were in. So was the squad that followed after them, and the one after that.\n\nA guard on duty caught the group as they walked through the halls and up the floors. "Hey, you aren't allowed to be here!" He reminded them sternly before being pinned against the wall and gutted like a fish right there by three of them.\n\nThat was the first resistance they had for a while. Two floors up, they spotted the first changeling they had come here to dispose of, a high officer called 'Ivl Meknasi' carrying paperwork to another room. He was a bit quicker on the draw, and managed to start yelling as he turned and ran before he was bowled over by a shovel thrown at his head. Urbiates caved his skull-chitin in and watched the blood pool for just a second before continuing on.\n\nJenom would have been a threat, and one of the group had a magical pistol just for him, but he was sluggish and probably drunk, and he was mowed down in a volley of machine gun fire as he turned a corner. At least fifty rounds went into him before his massive body hit the ground. That was eight floors up. They spat on his royal corpse as they passed.\n\nThe building thumped and echoed with gunshots punctuated by screams as they ascended higher and higher. Ten floors up, they found a few of the black-coated Vhy soldiers lying in the first successful ambush position yet. One of the squadron was shot in the leg before they could get the grenade out and continue.\n\nOn the top floor, they found Rosin, standing next to the service elevator shaft and staring at them with malice in his eyes. He was holding something glowing inside the great tunnel and started to speak, but they shot him before he could say anything."

Now they were all propped up against the back wall, perfectly still.\n\nThe Vhy had annexed this basement level quietly when they first arrived. Traffic down here was so low that nobody was sure why, because clearly they weren't hiding anything important.\n\nAnd sure enough, Little Vaspier had crowbarred open one of the many crates and found artillery shells. There were more in every crate they checked, and the biggest pile was in the shaft for the service elevator, which inexplicably had had the elevator itself removed to fit even more shells.\n\n"You know, I heard these guys were dumb, but I didn't think they'd be this dumb," Big Vaspier said as he sat on a pile of 88mm HE rounds. "Do they even have heavy artillery in this district? Or is it just their assault units?"\n\nXriotic looked up the service elevator shaft. "Come on, there has to be more to this." At the top was a small white light. Then a medium white light. He jumped back into the comforting concrete of the basement right before the road flare bounced off of the 120mm mortar rounds and settled on some 155mm. "What the hell!?" He shouted right before he caught the flare burning a red hole into the brass casing.\n\nThe basement stopped existing. A massive cloud of dust erupted from underground that covered the first few floors of the Palace.

"How did you figure this out?"\n\nThe Boffin adjusted his glasses. "Well, we took twenty-five percent of those remaining in the homeland, since back when we were working together that was their estimate for maximum efficient levying. Then we added five more percentage points for auxiliaries like Olenians and Equestrians, multiplied it by two for desperation, added three million bourgeois allies from overseas, removed three million for how many prospective enemies we could take out in a surprise attack, cut it in half to account for system shock, and removed a sixth of the remainder to account for casualties already taken. And for our side, I calculated how many changelings could be kept drunk 24/7 for six months using current production rates and reserves, which was naturally a lot for Severyana."\n\nThat sounded like airtight logic to Urbiates. "I see your concern. Do you have any ideas on how to shrink the gap?"\n\n"We might have to establish a real conscription system rather than taking whoever was sober or drunk enough to show up."

The great tanks of the Changeling Lands had worried him, had seemed unnatural and uncanny. Yet with the application of a 'canister' round and the push of a button, dozens of a nation's finest could be annihilated instantly. The Queens had always felt that the race was an aberration of nature and their followers accordingly looked to remove the natural world from their lives and to replace it with an unnatural one, but the spirits of their weapons were cold, single-minded, and at times as tyrannical as the Queens themselves. Yet their demands were repaid in letting one creature wreak the destruction which in times past would have required hundreds.\n\nHe was even a bit worried that tradition and the spirits of nature, passionate and virile (often to the point of chaos), were incapable of defeating those of the machinery.

Why would she worry about ruining a comfortable set of pajamas at the beach?  "Come on, I like it." Octy interjected. "The sun's warm, the water's warm. So what if she's wearing clothes? You can still enjoy yourself."\n\nUrbiates looked down at his own body. He was wearing nothing but a few pieces of string, and his stupid hat from some far-off land. "It's not fair." He muttered. Inspiration struck, and he pushed away the fair changeling maidens clustered around his comparatively massive and well-toned form. Octy tried to get one's attention, but he was not built like a statue, and she threw up in his sand bucket at the sight of his lanky and somewhat-disfigured form.\n\nUrbiates tapped Ann on the chest as she crawled out from the sea. "Listen, Ann. Everyone here is scantily-clad. You aren't. What gives?"\n\nShe looked around. "They're soft. I like them."\n\n"Yeah, well, it's not in the spirit of things. Creatures of every kind go to the beach to enjoy the water and to see what everyone else looks like underneath. Take off your clothes Ann Zhuk" He said authoritatively.\n\nShe looked around. "At least take me out to dinner first." The other male beachgoers, and a few females, all changelings since ponies had learned to avoid changeling crowds, were getting very interested in the conversation. "Okay, tell you what? How about we play a nice relaxing game of extreme beach volleyball? If you win, I'll show a bit more chitin."\n\nUrbiates smirked. "And if you win?"\n\n"Guess you'll just have to cover up?" She smirked back. Urbiates hit her hoof and turned back to the sands.\n\nThe girls on the beach scowled and grimaced. A few cursed. "Oh boy," Octy muttered.

She chucked the leather-bound sphere into the air and turned, bucking it with powerful legs. It sailed dully over the net, and Urbiates found himself wondering how little force she had to have put into it to make it fly so slow. Then he leapt to catch it, and was thrown to the ground and skidded two meters across the sand after it thudded into him like a freight train. It rolled off of him as he crawled up. "One-zero!" Ann yelled cheerfully.\n\n"What the hell?" Urbiates shouted through the pain. "That's not a volleyball!"\n\n"Of course not! It's a medicine ball!" She explained. "That's what makes it EXTREME beach volleyball!"\n\nUrbiates staggered to his feet and breathed heavily. The girls on the sidelines shouted encouragements. "You can do it!", "Show her what for!", and the like. Yet he was out of his depth and already behind his opponent.\n\nIf he lost, and he could lose, there could be a riot.  Octy chewed on the end of his hoof and muttered, "This is worse... with a hard 'r',"*. Urbiates had to pull through, for the good of everyone here. His face was covered in sheer determination. He understood what was needed of him.\n\n*TN: In its native changeling, that sentence does not have a single 'r' anywhere in it."

Both her and Urbiates were panting heavily from tossing the heavy ball around, and small craters marked the sand where impacts had blown away fragments. Urbiates was putting everything he had into it and he could feel his muscles were at their breaking point. She wouldn't last much longer either, but betting on it was not a good deal, she clearly had experience with this. The only way out he could see was that, if he tied her and then stopped playing for exhaustion reasons, no one would reproach him for wanting to be able to walk home from his fun beach vacation, and he would have escaped a loss.\n\nSo it all came down to this. And he knew just what to do.\n\nShe threw the medicine ball into the air and punched it so hard it sounded like a gunshot, causing it to sail over the net to him. He leapt into the air, his wings flapping as hard as they could to give him a bit more force as he turned 180 degrees and bucked the leather sphere with everything he had, knocking him out of balance and dropping him to the ground in a heap. Yet when he looked up, the ball was still airborne. It flew over Ann, over the border of the field, over the sands, into the road, and through the windshield of a passing truck.\n\nThe flatbed veered off and narrowly missed any of the partyers as it flipped over and plowed into the water. A pony ran from behind it. "Oh,water around the truck discolored from the chemicals. The driver clambered out of the cab and shouted "I'm okay!" before all his skin melted off and left naught but a bleach-white skeleton. "Oh, beans!" He added.\n\n"I think that's enough for one day." Urbiates said. "And really, we all have more important things we ought to be doing.

"So how did I do?"\n\nBehind the glass, the  technician replied, "I guess we'll see. I'm getting messages from our contacts abroad, they got it. It's official, we're the first Prandialist Revolutionary State."\n\nThere were a group of other changelings at phones, ready to receive the supplication and/or defiance of national leaders and whoever else felt it was necessary.

Radios confused him, and he sometimes doubted they worked at all.\n\nThe technician came back and answered, "We have a report from an Equestrian agent on signal penetration.

For the eighteenth time in the last year, it was a cesspool of gunshots and pained screaming, but that wasn't so bad. This time, it wasn't an overzealous partisan attack or a raid on the ghettos, it was the final purge of the Vhy and all their companions. They had holed up in any building they could, and their machine guns were extracting a toll on the Prandialist forces, but so what? There would always be more.\n\nEven in death, the soldiers of the Vhy were undignified, fighting side-by-side with the ponies to try and hold on a little longer. Urbiates wondered if, crammed into closets and basements, the remaining fighters realized how despicable and worthless their allies were. It served them right for playing with their food in such base ways.\n\n"If you listen closely," He proclaimed loudly so he could be heard over the wind that ran over his chitin, "You can hear Ichorograd itself talking."\n\n"I can't, there's too much wind."

Urbiates asked. "Go in and kill everyone like usual?"\n\n"That's one option." The leader said. "We went in with twenty-five thousand comrades, but now we know what the situation is and where their defenses are, and we only lost five thousand to do it. We've got over sixty thousand in reifnrocements now, we could force our way to the docks, but it'll be pretty dangerous and there won't be a lot of survivors, partisan or otherwise." He stood around awkwardly. "Really, it's only Ravenskoye. It's a B-grade town only good for the navy, and we're not like those Ditrysium weirdos. Why can't we just... burn it all down?"\n\nUrbiates looked at him in shock. "NO We can't 'burn it all down'! Ravenskoye is a city of tens of thousands!

She tried to crawl back into the building but a barrage of shots marked the sidewalk with craters. She cursed and ran back to the metal husk.\n\nAbove her, planes flew overhead. A lot of them, and heavy ones. So they did get the air force. Except the Prandialists didn't have a lot of twin-engines, and those bombs were falling awfully slowly. Then the planes stopped coming. Over the next fifteen minutes, the closest gunfire came to a close, and soon enough a Vhy soldier in a strange uniform came up with his bizarre rifle. "I see you lot have managed to not kill yourselves." He opened, standing brazenly in the open to talk to Scoria.\n\n"What the hell? Who asked you to show up?" She demanded.\n\n"Upper Ravenskoye." He explained as her teammates peeked from behind the piles of rubble around them. "They didn't think their local forces could handle it and called in some experts.

"Want me to sub in?" Octy suggested. He hadn't contributed much to the discussion, but he had watched the entire thing.\n\nUrbiates waved him down. "No, I argued for this, I should explain it." He stumbled through the back halls out of Ichorograd and found one of the busier streets. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. He found an empty crate and the stand owner could see in his eyes what Urbiates wanted. The box slid over and Urbiates stood on it. The revolutionary wondered if the box was full of soap, or at least had been. "Attention, good folks of Ichorograd! Those of you who read the news may have heard that the other two of the allied factions wanted to renegotiate the partition. The concept was that, although we would retain full sovereignty in our most secure areas such as this very hive, any areas outside of it would, for every faction, be held in overlapping jurisdictions. This concept was heard by a council of influential thinkers before thousands of witnesses, and they voted 17-15 to accept this proposal with crowd approval."\n\nUrbiates was a fiery and spectacular speaker, and changelings began to stop their travel so that they could hear his justification for why the decision had been made, and what strange places his ranting would take him. He continued to speak loudly to be heard over the din. "The truth is that, as a movement, as a faction, we have things we are good at and things we are bad at. And with who we are, with the numbers we have, we cannot handle everythign. So we have replaced control with cooperation. Yes, we now own one-third of every square kilometer!""

"Any dissenters to this opinion will be treated as revisionist, unless they are under chemical influence, or their listeners are, or no one cares."\n\nHe cleared his throat as a few of his audience politely clapped. He wasn't sure why they did that sometimes. "The second most important order of business which was discussed was a recent incident involving tunnel construction in an eastern district of this city. A number of our patriots attempted to build a barricade in the street to control the flow of traffic ahead of a potential riot. Some pricks from the Vhy came by, in their, in their cars, and stuff, and they said they needed that road. This incident resulted in the deaths of 7 Vhy thugs and 36 revolutionary martyrs." Urbiates was so proud of them. The Vhy had only one-sixth the population of the Prandialists and was 99% military-aged. It was a good trade, demographically. "While this was a heroic act, I should remind you all that we are supposed to negotiate this issue, bringing it to higher authorities if necessary, rather than enforcing our spirit.

Well, it is true." Rosin loudly spoke to the assembly. "I have come to announce that One March and his 'White Equalists' will be joining us and the Prandialists as a sanctioned faction within the Severyana Protectorate, and will be receiving some land with which to develop their operations. They will take over most of the functions of government-local communications and of international diplomacy." He paused. The changelings spread out before him looked to each other, and then mumbled, and then started to argue loudly.\n\nRosin realized he had made an error. "I am sorry, everyone, I should be more diplomatic. We shall vote on it. One changeling, one vote." The rabble sat back down. Rosin brought out a piece of paper and wrote 'yes' on it in large, elegant letters. Then he held it up for all to see. "The vote is 'yes', the motion passes.""

"I didn't realize that a pony could understand that stuff." Voran said, recalling back to the grandiose speeches praising the 'changeling spirit of collectiveship' and the 'primacy of the whole'.\n\n"He's still a pony, right? And so are his friends?" Vaspera asked, feeling the same sense that someone had just explained her own beliefs back to her. "Even if it sounds like it, I find it hard to believe he really 'gets' it."\n\nVoran motioned with his spoon. "That's the thing, though. I do believe it. I've heard lots of a ponies try to explain what I believe to me, and it never fits. They don't get it. They say we think we're the master race, that we want to rule the world. But this one... he does get it."\n\n"But we are the master race." Vaspera reminded him. "And we do want to rule the world."\n\n"Not like they say. It's not because of who we are, but what we believe. We know how important the greater good is better than any other race, and how it's the basis of all progress. And we want that progress for the whole world. And so does he." Voran paused. "I think I always knew that, but only now am I realizing it."\n\n"I see it." Vaspera looked down at the brown soup. "I didn't know why I or anyone else voted 'yes' to his idea of becoming a co-owner of the Zone, but I guess you could be onto something.""

severyana_c.3.d:0 "The transformation of Stalliongrad into Ichorograd had been nearly total. One March sat in a smoking-room-turned-office and stared out the window at the scuffed city, dim under the sky of concrete and dirt. It was as if the neighborhood had simply been magically crammed into an underground cavern. "How'd it go?" He asked no one in particular. Rosin knew it wasn't a question for him.\n\n"How the hell did you hear me?" Urbiates asked.\n\n"We are very in tune with our surroundings," March said, Rosin helping him to cover up that it was the twenty-third time he had tried that. "What about the councils?"\n\nUrbiates stepped fully into the room. "Well, they heard your program, and they talked about it for a long time, but a lot of them really liked it, and the rest didn't think it was offensive. The vote barely passed, but in the long run, I think they'll appreciate having your group around."\n\nRosin sat up from the desk he was slumped over at. "Well, then. I've already set up the order to incorporate your organization when the news of this breaks. It seems we have a third partner. Welcome to the club."\n\nMarch smiled. "We're honored to be counted as your equals," he replied politely. Rosin shook his hoof cordially, and Urbiates just looked askew at it. "Now then. When do we get our own space on the flag?"\n\nRosin chuckled. "I suppose we can just divide it into thirds instead of halves and give one to you. The di-flag was hardly an elegant design, though, and making it a tri-flag won't help, so I am open to suggestions."\n\n"We have some ideas, but it's a question for another time, we guess." March shrugged. "Still, if you have any alcohol here, it would be a good time to toast to the future. One where such petty things as 'the individual' aren't fretted over."\n\n"Hear, hear!" Urbiates cheered. "Hear is where you should pass the beer!""

severyana_c.4.d:0 "The ticking of the clock was as loud as thunder in the meeting room in the Palace. Rosin stared cautiously at the grey pony who they were here to talk to, and Urbiates was distracted with the sundial around his wrist and the fact it wasn't telling the time. "So... what's your deal?" The Kommandant demanded.\n\n"Our... deal?" The grey pony asked.\n\n"He's asking if you're into stallions." Urbiates commeneted.\n\n"No." Rosin glared daggers at the rebel. "I'm asking what your deal is. I was told this meeting would be productive and that I had to be in the same room as the amazing brainless bug over there, so please, get to the point."\n\nThe pony steeled himself. He knew some things about the two ponies currently presiding over his fate, but the only thing he was sure about was that either one would kill him for wasting their time. "This is One. We have a lot of respect for the way your race thinks and operates, and we've been trying to imitate it, fitting your collectivist tendencies into the brain of a pony. The results have been interesting, and we believe we can use it to bridge the gap between you and your subjects."\n\n"One what?" Urbiates asked. "Like, one IQ point?"\n\nOne was unphased. "Our name was originally 'One March'. We decided that names were excessive individualism and left them behind. We only need the collective."\n\n"A bold concept. Not wholly wrong, either. But where does it all lead?" Rosin resolutely stared at One. "The common ant also only needs the collective, but they are not a glorious civilization, they are pests."\n\n"They can also be found in every community with more than two creatures in it." Urbiates reminded him, entranced by what the pony was saying.\n\n"It shouldn't be controversial to say that your own factions within the nation have an image problem, at home and abroad." One began. "The root of my proposition is that you should let us have some room to breathe within your system, and we will try to fix that.""

"I like him. I can't imagine why, but I do."\n\nUrbiates stroked his chin as if he ever had more than one thought in his head. "His idea is... the word is per-... per-something, I forgot. Whatever it is, I'm getting hopeful that maybe one day our children don't have to learn how to carry a gun to get a bottle of milk."\n\n"Persuasive." Rosin commented. "That's the word. And yes, our own forces are having that problem, too. I wonder- wait, where the hell are you getting the milk? We have hardly any damn herd animals in this country."\n\nUrbiates waved his hoof. "It was a hypno- hypoder- hippopo-"\n\n"Hypothetical."\n\n"Yeah, that. So, what are you thinking, trial run?"\n\nRosin stood around awkwardly. "I'm as shocked by your willingness to accept a pony into our ranks as I am that, had you not suggested that, I would have. How far this country has fallen..."\n\n"Don't kid yourself. This hellhole hit bedrock long ago." Urbiates commented. He turned. "Alright, you might be a sub-creature, but we'll give you a shot, not because our country is in trouble or anything, we just pity you. Stab us in the back and you and your friends will be displayed on the Palace spire after having your flesh removed from your body."\n\n"Thank you for letting us help fix your extremely functional political system." One said courteously. "The White Equalists look forwards to working with you and your followers.""

severyana_c.6.t:0 "Hamlet, Hocklet"
severyana_c.6.d:0 ""The basic unit of the counterinsurgency is the 'friendly population'," One explained as he showed a diagram of a village his followers had annexed for themselves. They had brought in a number of ponies from outside the group to convert them through peer pressure. So far, the place was being run more like a cult than like a security force, but supposedly this was in fact part of civilian-level national defense. "You have to make as many population centers into mono-ideologies. If it's your side, you only have to defend one place to secure all the creatures within. If it's their side, you can kill them all without consequence."\n\n"It's a simple proposition," Rosin admitted. "Yet it hasn't worked for us. What makes you different?"\n\n"Well, for one, we are willing to offer the subjects something besides protection from their friends. Exemption from the vicissitudes of national affairs, at least compared to those on the outside." One said. It was true, the first few of the hamlets set up under the 'White Equalists' had exemption from many of the more aggressive policies as part of their benefits. They only had to flash a badge and they were above many of the laws. It was how the ponies in them were encouraged to behave. In fact, every pony who bought into this system left a higher burden on those who didn't, encouraging them to buy in also. "Once this is working, you will make up for it in what you can do to those outside the system."\n\nRosin stared at the diagram. It was theoretically sensible but it was not his wheelhouse. "Well, let's hope it goes according to plan." He would need some independent verification, but that was not hard to come by."

severyana_c.7.t:0 "Death and Taxes..."
severyana_c.7.d:0 "The three leaders were back in the meeting room, although this time, they each came with an entourage. Rosin had his officers, and Urbiates had a raucous rabble, and One had a pair of staffers who, despite being different shapes and colors, bore a resemblance to the grey pony in their mannerisms. "I have called you here today to discuss a matter of the nation's finances!" One loudly spoke to get the attention of the others and cut short the side conversations. "Something we have noticed is that hardly anypony pays any sort of tax. So-called 'irregular' levies of money and objects are, in fact, what sustains the government."\n\n"It's not 'hardly anypony'." Rosin admitted during the pause after one of his cohort whispered into his ear. "It's 'nopony'. We couldn't get anyone to pay the duties consistently, and we didn't have enough soldiers to start making examples of the ones who kept foraging anyways, so we just gave up. It's worked... kind of... but if you think your angle can solve that, too, then it is worth exploring."\n\nUrbiates raised a hoof. "What are taxes? I know, I just want to make sure you do."\n\n"They're a payment you make to the government so they don't come to your house and shoot you." One explained patiently.\n\n"Oh! Those! I, uh, mean, yes that is correct, good job." Urbiates stammered to the solemn nods of his friends. The Prandialists paid taxes in labor directly, and they too had their goons forage from the Severyanans for materials and other things.\n\nOne was unperturbed. "Well, we need to fix that. Consistency is key. It's impossible for ponies to accept the requisitions if they can never get used to them."\n\n"Like water-drop torture." Rosin interjected.\n\n"Yes, like that." One agreed. "From our research, it seems like the main issue was that paying taxes was hard and didn't do anything helpful. Making our community membership contingent on continual tithing would fix the lack of incentive.""

severyana_c.8.t:0 "Hitting the Books"
severyana_c.8.d:0 ""Remind me again why this is my problem," Rosin grunted as he aggressively dropped the copy of "The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State" onto the end table. To Rosin, who had seen sickly-sweet wealth and crushing poverty, autocratic kingdoms and ad-hoc tribal justice, tyrants and anarchy, international empires and isolated enclaves, all on Equus and then again on Griffonia, this book was unsuitable to be a respectable creature's doorstop. It was a type he had seen often in his university days, utter fiction written with courage by an academic who failed to realize they had left their field. It was the third book by the author Rosin had read, the fifth in his socialist spree, and he was getting impatient with it and the consistent, insistent, anti-factuality.\n\nOne picked up the book and replaced it with another. "You said it yourself once. Leftists are a gullible bunch, and we believe that if you say the right words, you can get at least a few of them to look fondly on us."\n\n"So make Urbiates do it." Rosin pointed out as he adjusted himself in his reading chair. "He's actually a leftist. Kind of."\n\n"Urbiates can't read, starts verbal slap fights with people who want an excuse to kill him, and hates everyone who's not a political ally. He's as bright as Nightmare Moon and twice as violent. We're not letting him handle PR." One said politely.\n\nRosin grunted again. "You might be onto something." He turned his head down and picked up "The Conquest of Rice", translated into Wingbardian since he could not read Brodfeldian, and went back to reading. At this rate, he would be done in only three days."

severyana_c.9.t:0 "Civil Discourse"
severyana_c.9.d:0 "The grand Aquileian hall was remarkably subtle for the nation's normal tastes. There wasn't even one massive claw-painted portrait or layer of golden leaf over all the walls. It was still opulent, and to Rosin's own sensibilities, used to the cold utility of changeling concrete anthills or the Palace, that temple to bureaucracy, it was especially alien. The effect wasn't helped by the mob of well-dressed socialists and communists, nearly all of whom were staring at him. He hadn't been invited to this meeting of the International, but when one has the resources of a major country at their disposal, crashing a party is no large feat no matter what party it is.\n\nInformation out of Severyana was scarce, but rumors of the horrors unfolding there were pervasive, not least because the Vhy and Prandialists were both seen by the world as deviant organizations with deviant leaders. But wasn't that also how they were seen by their own government? Rosin patiently explained to a Griffenheim union boss that they were the revolutionaries of their homeland. And he explained also to a disgusted Pridean that material realities had shown that not every socialist policy should be enacted immediately in their current situation. And he explained to a Skynavian egg-warmer revolutionary that the disposal of reactionary elements was a necessary, if ugly, part of any major progress. Most of those in attendance were not convinced by his staggered arguments and loose grasp of the philosophy, but they had to admit, there must have been a lot of intelligence behind the small creature for him to simultaneously hold three conversations in three languages.\n\nIt had been a process to sneak out of Severyana to get here, but when Rosin left the meeting in the late hours of night, he realized that that was good. It meant he could say whatever he wanted because he was the sole authoritative source on what was happening. Next time, he might have these fools arguing for him."

This was the headquarters of his Equalist government, and was where the special privileges the movement was afforded over the northern regions flowed from. He had been called here by 000014 Deep Thought to discuss the future of the ideology-state, and Thought was waiting with a number of other high-end directors, many of them also from the early days of the movement. "We have some concerns," Thought began.\n\nOne sat himself down and looked out the window at the cloudy sky. He knew where this was going. "What seems to be the problem?"\n\nThought glanced around. "It's your new allies. We've gone over the new documents they've made available to us, and all the things we can see now that we have so much influence, and... we cannot continue to work with the changelings in good conscience. They're too horrible."\n\nOne turned to them, friendly smile on his face hiding anticipation. "If that is how you feel about our allies, then we will miss you, but we will not force you to stay."\n\n"Actually... we decided it's you who should leave." Thought explained sternly.\n\n"You don't have that authority."\n\n"Authority isn't real. We have guarantees from every guard in the building that they won't interfere." Thought said, sliding a pistol to One's end of the table, doubtless loaded with one bullet. The phrase "you know what to do" was in his eyes.\n\nOne kept smiling as he put a hoof to his mouth and whistled. A half-dozen grey-coated guards, rifles and machine guns at the ready, piled into the room. "What did I tell ya, boss? Buncha damn rats. You should have ditched them long ago." The leader barked. The room flashed with green flares as they dropped their disguises.\n\nOne March stood up and walked behind the newcomers as they pointed their guns at the conspirators.

severyana_c.11.d:0 ""Propaganda? Isn't that just a fancy word for lying?" Urbiates asked.\n\n"Yes, except sometimes the lie is true." One March explained.\n\n"How confusing." Octy commented. "I can see why the Queens thought they could use it to keep the buggitariat down by tying them up in endless complexities."\n\n"Actually every country uses it." One pointed out. "Sometimes it's for mundane things, like convincing the populace to sign up for a government initiative that's good for them. Sometimes it's to change their mind and direct the conversation about a specific topic. Really, this state could use a large propaganda apparatus since, you know, you guys have an image problem."\n\nUrbiates looked around. "Maybe you do. I can see just fine."\n\nOne sighed in a way that he hope came out as charming instead of insulting. Urbiates had, like Rosin, asked to be brought into the discussions around national issues but had yet to understand even a single thing that was going on. His weird friend, a Greneclyfian according to Rosin, had a better vocabulary but also didn't have a clue. The two of them were maestros of violence and terror and hunting down their enemies, but meeting the most influential members of the movement had explained a bunch of things about how the nation was run... for both factions. "How about you just trust us to handle this properly?" One suggested, hopefully skipping half an hour of pointless discussion."

Leave time was lame as hell when you were stuck in a hole like Severyana, but the Vhy didn't like drinking on-duty, and Severyana was nothing if not a source of unlimited vodka, some of which was even made by real distilleries. It was a good thing, too. She had been young and stupid and wanted real war (not some pansy-ass guerilla fight) and the Royal Army was a hundred miles away, and the Vhy was willing to pay top dollar for a good markspony... joining the conflict like that had been a colossal mistake and she regretted the things she did and the things she saw, but her time in Severyana was so, SO much worse.\n\nWas. Rifle had noticed that, ever since those weird bug-worshippers-or-whatever-they-are took over, the amount of dead bodies you had to pass to get to the local bar was down, and the amount of ponies confidently walking the streets alone was up. It struck her that it had been a long time since she was dragged on an operation to wipe out some hamlet or another, and the other day she had seen her commander driving around town with the windows down.\n\nAgainst her better judgement, she smiled. Were things actually getting better? She passed two Equalist militiaponies guarding one of their commissar-equivalents as he argued with a shopowner about the necessity of flower arrangements as an industry and realized that yes, they were getting better, but she didn't need to fear it turning to "good" anytime soon.

He had received accolades and praise for being "a great patriotic worker" as he willingly and unquestioningly worked long hours in harsh conditions for no extra reward. The truth is, spending more time at work was a low price for attention.\n\nThen the bugs had taken over. Black-coated changelings watched from the rafters, ready to beat anyone who slowed down, and that had reduced how satisfied 015 was by his work. What had killed it was his co-workers. It turned out that they didn't like being overshadowed for so long, they didn't like that he was still working, and they certainly didn't like that he wasn't seething with rage all the time like they were. For years, he had labored under the scorn of his new bosses and his old peers alike, simply for doing what he had always done. He might have rebelled with them, but they all liked him for his product, not himself. Never himself. He wasn't going to lift a single hoof for them.\n\nNow, 015 was back on top. Wearing only grey, replacing his name with a number, all that was demeaning, but he was once again a "great patriotic worker" as declared to the strange ponies who had replaced the bugs at his factory. He got to use the special entrances and exits, avoid the pat-downs, disagree with the overtime schedule, but he liked the money, so he was going to be staying late today, well into the next shift.\n\n015 had a rusty pistol in his pocket that he had found in the mud.

"We aren't going to lose hundreds of our best mathematicians because your own can't count right!"\n\n"Ours can't count?!" Rosin roared back, standing up from his chair. "You damn fool, the average education level of our soldiers is four years ahead of your own, and you assume it's our fault?"\n\nSo that's what it was about this time. With the Equalists as intermediaries, One had been trying to get the Prandialists and the Vhy to work together instead of pointing guns at each other whenever a leaf fell on the wrong side of Ichorograd. However, there was a problem when it came to logistics. The Vhy represented a few hundred thousand creatures, of which 99% were in the military apparatus. The average Prandialist could reliably count to four. Every educated pony in the country, with scant few exceptions, had either died or left. It was common for the wrong things to be delivered to the wrong place in the wrong quantity by the wrong method, and gunfights had started over this before.\n\nOne butted in. "What if we had a dedicated accounting branch?"\n\n"An interesting idea, but  our limited skilled mathematicians would never work with these subcreatures, and theirs feel the same way, and even you don't have enough ponies who can speak changeling to work alongside ours." Rosin explained. "And since, let's face it, it's mostly them making the errors, it should be on them to fix it."\n\nUrbiates scoffed.

She was a former police chief who had managed to return to something like her old job after being vouched for by a number of her former colleagues. She continued. "And it's only a matter of time until political radicals start doing the same thing, if they haven't already. If there is any money leftover in the budget, well, we need to expand Internal Security.

He wondered if they were arguing something new this time. Urbiates caught sight of One has he passed and he snapped out of his warrior's rage and ran over. "Hey, funny Equalist guy! I have an update on that one thing you were asking about!"\n\nUnsurprisingly, working with ponies in a large capacity had been a continuing source of controversy in Prandialist circles. That some ponies somewhere were logically more useful as allies than as calories didn't matter to the anti-rational revolutionaries. Plus, many Prandialists never bothered to learn Severyanan, or even Equestrian.\n\nUrbiates uncrumpled a note from his jacket and handed it to Octy, who began to read it out loud. "Equalist popularity is at 66%, up by 7 points from last year. Communication problems are down by 23% since last year, representing 22 points. Incidence of partisan activities is down by 108%. I don't think that's possible. Remind me to call the mathematics council and tell them to check their methodology. Don't read this part, Octy.

One said.\n\n"Hey, this is important. We all gotta make sacrifices, right?" Urbiates replied. "It's like how I'm always calling Rosin gay. It makes him mad as hell for some reason. He's not gay though, has a wife and everything, but if I started talking about her, he would just f*cking shoot me, and the Prandialists would retaliate, and we'd all be doomed. Makes sense, right?"\n\nOne was startled not by the lack of perspective, but by that little tidbit. "He never mentioned her."\n\nUrbiates sighed.

He was passing by, and the changeling was staring out the window at the dirty ruins of Stalliongrad, looking older once again.\n\n"They're making do." Rosin grumbled. The main thing keeping the Prandialists from giving up on the Equalists was that the Vhy was fully behind the ponies, and even the Prandialists were hesitant to fight the Vhy directly. Of course, the Vhy wasn't fully behind the ponies either, but Rosin was, and no one in the Vhy would disagree with the Fuhrer openly.\n\nOne rubbed his chin contemplatively. "They have such a changeling way of doing things. Even their mob rule is explicitly dictatorial. I appreciate how much more reliable your own side is. When you fail to do something, I never wonder if it was intentional."\n\nRosin turned away from the window. "I'm making do, too." He admitted as he slumped into his chair, defeated. "I'm sorry, you should probably leave. I'm in a bad mood."\n\n"It's fine. What's wrong?" One asked.\n\nThe Kommandant, so stalward in public, had never before been quite this dejected in private. "I miss my wife. It's been so many years. I write her letters I can't send. I wonder if she does the same for me. She could be dead and I would have never heard."\n\n"You have a wife?" One pretended to be surprised.\n\nRosin nodded solemnly. "Greatest author I've ever met, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. She can tell you your life story after talking to you for five minutes. Twenty years haven't dulled her beauty. If Urbiates, or any of the thugs in his troupe, or any of the thugs in mine, if they even said her name I wouldn't be able to stop myself and it would destroy us all.

Sometimes that emergency was something that needed his attention so soon he couldn't make the few-hour trip back north to his normal headquarters. Sometimes that emergency was that One had had to deal with both of the changeling leaders and needed a break. He grinned subtly as he imagined the founding fathers of Stalliongrad being mutilated for eternity in Tartarus for turning the region into a starving hellhole that could even lose to these blathering idiots.\n\nWell, they were good for some things. Rosin could be a good figurehead or organizer when he wasn't stuck doing both at the same time. Urbiates was terrible at everything but the Prandialists thought he was the best thing since canned bread and that meant he could kind of sort of direct them to sometimes be helpful.\n\nHe thought about something that Rosin had said. "Prandialists. National Socialists. We both came here to defeat the monster of bolshevism. We were ready to dedicate our bodies and souls to it. It was our sole thought. We thought it would fix us, make us whole and happy. Yet with you, we have discovered that it wasn't the end of bolshevism that we needed, it was each other."\n\n"You're saying the real monsters were the friends we made along the way." One March had pointed out. "Care to try that again?"\n\nRosin had just taken a long sip of his coffee and answered, "No."\n\nOne relaxed into his chair and didn't even bother pretending to work. The Kommandant wasn't really wrong. This nation was a sewer. One pulled a flank flask from a drawer and drank the water inside, pure spring water from the northern mountains. Accept no substitute.\n\nThis nation was a sewer, and for the first time, after a period of instability, One was the new rat-king. About damn time."

Currently, the most popular theory is that he was born to a herder family near Lyctida in the days when that region was still deeply troubled. This explains a lot of things about his provenance, like his low level of education (he admits that he dictates his essays because he cannot read or write), his lack of a paper trail (the bureaucracy in the region was still shoddy when he was born, especially for herders), and the absence of any pre-existing associations in the hive. Although he hasn't consistently reported his birth date, he is about the right age to have been at the end of that period, and his skill with various weapons could easily have been nurtured by the more independent and armed herders.\n     This doesn't explain everything, though. Herders are known for being not only illiterate, but monolingual, yet Urbiates can somehow also speak Equestrian and Severyanan fluently even though the former was scarcely taught in that  region and the latter was practically unknown. He is also massive and his body doesn't bear the hallmarks of larval malnutrition. So is he secretly a foreign-born? Maybe, but those can usually read in at least one language, and Urbiates's understanding of the outside world is lacking.\n     I apologize for adding to the confusion, but as far as his personality goes, if you're reading this, you probably already know the important parts. He is the kind of creature who thinks that Caramel Marks is more important to him than his birth hive. If you see him, kill him. If you don't see him, leave, he's too dangerous for you.\n\n~S.

He was born in the Spring in a backwater province of distant Greneclyf. His family were herb farmers, and though Octy showed enough promise to move up in the world, he rarely put in the effort necessary and thus was assumed to take over the family business. While known for his happy-go-lucky attitude, his odd lisp, and his unassailable spirit, what he would become most famous for was a criminal case where a series of disappearances were linked back to him.\n     The bodies were badly mangled and the victims seemed to have been chosen by how deeply they had offended him personally at one time or another. Octy showed no regret and no remorse in the brief moments before he fled the town, and eventually, the entire country, and faded into the background. The federal government warned many of their closest neighbors about him and that is how we were first alerted to him. A year later, he would arrive in Lyctida and fall in with the Prandialists, making fast friends with Urbiates and becoming a significant (if unassuming) figure from there. Between what actions we could tie to him and the descriptions that the Greneclyfian authorities gave us, we believe him to be a Dennite, a remarkable discovery as we thought those could only be born from the mountains of the far north of our country.\n     As with any Dennite, you cannot trust anything he says or does as representative of how he will behave in the future.

There is a theory that Urbiates is not one figure but a collection of changelings going under the same name at various points, and while I personally disagree, that is what I believe happens here.\n     The legend of Anastasia Zhuk is that she is a foreign-born from Severyana who followed the infiltrators home after the Winter Revolution. Her experiences in the revolution taught her the value of radical action, strong violence, and depersonalizing opponents early and often. She is a dedicated fighter for the revolution and is one of the most prolific terrorists, using her charm to change hearts and minds and using guns and bombs on those who remain. In Prandialist culture, this is considered virtuous.\n     Despite this, her actual personality is odd and seems more like a joke or a fairy tale than like something a real person would do.

As he stalked the halls of the 13th floor, thinking about whether "kommandant" or "fuhrer" sounded nicer, the thin bubble of soap that was his good mood popped as he came across Jenom steadying himself against one of the decorated walls.

Supposedly, it was so there was no way for the Prandialists to sneak out, but Vesalipolis had been perfectly willing to take anything of strategic significance, or of value, and given nothing back. Even information about the outside world was sparse, and setting up a radio tower on their side of the border to keep open communication lines should not have been difficult, yet that too was denied to this collection of war heroes.\n\nRosin turned around in his chair and looked at the desolate wasteland formerly known as Stalliongrad. He mentally went over all of the divisions under his command and realized that they were all the ones which had somehow offended the Queen, no matter how minor the slight. Even his own, since he had signed off on a very illegal stratagem as part of the Battle for Canterlot. That it saved thousands of lives was clearly no issue.\n\nHe realized what he had been brought into: Severyana wasn't a prison where the Vhy were the wardens, it was a firing squad where the Vhy were the only ones given a blindfold.\n\nSo Jenom, in his drunken stupor, had been right.

Rosin licked his lips.\n\n"Soldiers of the hives! Of the volk! I have long thought about our predicament, and I have come to the same realization as many of you!" He shouted. His voice echoed around the plaza. "We cannot leave! We cannot get help! We cannot even talk to our families across the border! We have been abandoned! Betrayed by our supposed leader and left to rot in this hole! This is what Chrysalis has done to our nation's most loyal soldiers!"\n\nThe crowd murmered. Rosin had their attention. "She thinks she can stab us in the back just because we would agree to it?" He continued. "I say, TO HELL WITH THAT! Tomorrow, we march! The Prandialists can keep this tire fire of a nation! She won't be able to ignore us as we return to our homes, to our country, under arms and extract the victory we were denied from her! This is the beginning of a new age! One where the liar-Queen shall be dethroned, and the true patriots of our Reich shall lead us into a golden age! With these words, I DECLARE WAR ON THE QUEEN!"\n\nThe crowd was to jeering and cheering, and although Rosin couldn't gauge their emotional content, he wouldn't have cared. Those who disagreed would be left behind. It was a new dawn.\n\nLiterally.\n\nSadly, he and his audience were reduced to microscopic sub-debris before they could notice it."

The engine kicked on and the vehicle turned onto the wrong side of the road as it sped up. The great cloud began to take on the shape of a mushroom. The rumbling continued distantly.\n\nUrbiates looked at the ponies on the streets, saw their faces as they passed, and noticed that many of them who were no longer distracted by the great cloud bore an expression he was intimately familiar with.

severyana_e.0.d:0 "In the push-and-pull that characterized the attempt of the changelings to hold onto Severyana for dear life, it was not only soldiers and weapons that had to be traded to keep back the partisan threat. At times, entire regions would be abandoned by the settlers who were meant to make it safe for living, what materials they could carry resold to fund some other project. And yet, as the threats piled on, the government found itself trading more and more of the land too, until one day, the city of a thousand names - Princessyn, Solargrad, Stalliongrad, Ichorograd - was left behind as well. When the changelings fled that grand city, they knew not where they would go next. They only knew that they couldn't stay where they were.\n\nThe partisans soon came in behind them. They bickered and fought, but in the end, they found an unquestioned leader. The oppressors remained trapped between the birthplace they were exiled from and the homeland they were expelled from. They tried to hide in the cracks of the new society, and whenever they were found, no law or custom dictated what to do with them, except the law of nature in which the strong do as they will and the weak do as they must, and the strong had no desire for restraint or magnanimity. Thus was life when the Severyanan experiment came to a close.\n\nLike the ancient Minotaurs of Kerato throwing their disfigured youths to the wild animals of their land, Queen Chrysalis looked upon the dismemberment of her own problem children with disappointment, but not regret."

He was standing on a friend in order to get a clear view from the back of the former city square, but even if he had been on that stage, he wouldn't have known what was going on. Rosin had invited himself in to ask that the hive, and the broader Prandialist community, give up on their independent Prandialism and let his organization take control of the entire country. For the first time in a long while, everyone the boy had known had a strong opinion on which way the vote would go, but they didn't all agree.\n\nRosin had come with armed guards. Urbiates had chosen to be his counter-debater, and he had also brought armed guards. The two had been screaming at each other for the last hour as their goons bristled. The boy had seen both of them, and knew that this wasn't unusual, but for some reason it felt pathetic this time.\n\nOutside the hive, everyone was wondering what direction the power struggle would take. They huddled around radios and televisions, and they worried about their leaders. "This is our leadership?" One said. "I can't believe that these are the most influential creatures," said another. For a brief moment in time, the pogroms, the raids, the reprisals, and all the other tasks of the occupation would cease, and they never were as strong or as determined as they had been.\n\nAnd in the Zone, that was all it took to throw apart the delicate balance between the changeling factions and their miserable subjects."

severyana_e.3.t:0 "A Common Occurence"
severyana_e.3.d:0 "After a recent series of skirmishes along the Zlatotsvet-Sovyenok line between revolutionaries and eq***oid freedom fighters associated with SKVD werewolf groups, the Northern Border Counter-Reactionary Forum was convened and a decision was made. The next morning, a platoon of our comrades took stolen SKVD uniforms and moved against a village thought to be the center of freedom fighter activity. There, it was found that the Vhy had, as part of a disagreement with the Border Negotiation Forum, moved a small security garrison into the town. They were easily chased away, being unwilling to fight and die for the ponies, at which point our comrades tracked down SKVD sympathizers and publically executed them for invented treasons.\n\nThat afternoon, as expected, real SKVD operators entered the town and were fired upon by disaffected and organized ponies. They forced their way to the town center and publically executed the loudest dissidents, taking some casualties along the way, and then left. It was thought that that was the end of the operation, for that village would no longer be so open to the SKVD and our negotiations with the village heads could begin.\n\nThat evening, Vhy reinforcements arrived with tanks, surrounded the village, and levelled it. There were few to no survivors.\n\nExtreme as this example might be, counter-reactionary activities are fighting an uphill battle even when the Vhy isn't involving themselves. The ponies are vain and, no matter how much we discredit their 'saviors', they refuse to accept their position as prey animals for long. To the West and South we constantly hear similar stories.\n\nSomething must be done about this but we do not know what. We put it to the Forum of Prandialism to find a solution. So says the Forum of Zlatotsvet."
severyana_e.3.e:0 "During our debates with the Prandialist's Border Negotiation Forum, a village we were arguing over fell under attack. We had placed a squad of our security forces there and they were chased away by a larger force of SKVD partisans early in the morning. They left a few of their number behind to watch from a distance while the rest went to the nearby encampment, where they found 253. Sicherungs-L.P.V. and 44. Schwere Panzer-Abteilung and returned that evening. As the SKVD partisans had been doing their business all throughout the day, the ranking officer decided to quarantine the problem and liquidate the village.\n\nAfter a series of diplomatic protests, we now believe that there were two groups of supposed "SKVD" combatants. The first was actually a Prandialist warband performing a false flag attack, and we ruined their plan by killing the witnesses to their trick. We cannot confirm or deny this, the Prandialists love to make things up and insist they are true, sometimes even believing it themselves. At the same time, it would not be surprising if we interrupted a scheme of theirs and they decided it was easier to throw a petrol bomb through our front window than it was to talk to us.\n\nRegardless of who stepped on who's coattails, what we know for a fact is that both our factions have different ways of dealing with the partisan threat and both of our factions are struggling. If the rebel factions unified, we would be swept away within the month, and the fact that they all blame each other for losing the war is our only lifeline. All of them are growing in strength and incidents are growing in frequency no matter how many of their allies we kill."

Approximately ten minutes after clearing the building, a gun battle started with the partisans who were the objective of the raid, and Katsia proceeded to similarly clear three more buildings ('Steel Stallion Polio Treatment Hospital', 'Worker's Luxury Motel', 'Strelki Street Liquor Store') before reaching the site of the conflict. There, she was wounded in action when she attempted to attack a partisan with a sledgehammer and was shot by his pistol.\n\nAnd all that.

The door thundered open and a second group of ponies flooded into the room, rifles and pistols and submachine guns pointed at the ragged wanderers. "What are you doing?" One of them asked nervously. "We have nothing left. Please let us keep what we could carry."\n\nThe leader of the armed party motioned and one of her companions opened up a discarded saddlebag.

SEV_3rd_div_desc:0 "Infantry with heavy self-propelled artillery support.\n\nEmblem: Golden Spiral\n\nPressed into frontline service from its defensive role, the newly-expanded security force was given heavy artillery and a new commanding officer: Doctor Rosin Lyctia, a personal friend of Captain Dieter Heinrich and respected researcher. It's combat record under his command was generally average, and their highest claim to fame was participating in the siege of Canterlot, after which they were permanently transferred to the Stalliongrad front. Many suspect they set the blaze that won that battle, but the Queen has declared that untrue."
SEV_4th_div:0 "4th "Rot" Division"
SEV_4th_div_desc:0 "Infantry with some anti-tank, artillery, and anti-air, plus medium tank destroyers.\n\nEmblem: Exponential Growth Curve\n\nThe Vhy 4th Division was originally Lyctidan, but after it was destroyed in its first battle, the name was turned over to the largest pony collaborator force. The ponies of the "Rot", or the N.O.E., were an eclectic group of outcasts and ex-convicts who took whatever they could salvage and had little respect for the Queen's rules of war. Somehow, their strange mix of stolen equipment kept them alive no matter how many times they were used as cannon fodder."
SEV_7th_div:0 "7th "Blodtruppen" Division"
SEV_7th_div_desc:0 "Mechanized infantry with a bias towards anti-tank ability.\n\nEmblem: Axe in a Pony Skull\n\nOne of the few Vhy divisions recruited from a specific hive that wasn't Lyctidia, the Vraksians of the 7th "Blodtruppen" weren't known for their extremism or bloodlust. In spite of this, the division was responsible for a substantial number of massacres, exterminations, and general failure to follow orders, which their officers always claimed to be freak accidents caused by individual soldiers making logical errors in the field."
SEV_9th_div:0 "9th "Mercury" Division"
SEV_9th_div_desc:0 "Motorized with artillery.\n\nEmblem: Tangent Lines\n\nStarting out as a brigade, the 9th "Mercury" was boosted by its commander being related to the manager of a car factory. When Vhy brigades began to be expanded to full-sized divisions to fill the holes, the one which was already entirely motorized (kind of) was one of the first. During the war, it recieved some of the most notorious orders of the war and carried each one out dutifully. This unlucky streak left the division with a terrible reputation that still persists."
SEV_11th_div:0 "11th "Monarchin" Division"
SEV_11th_div_desc:0 "Motorized with some extra armor for support.\n\nEmblem: Long S\n\nOne of the Vhy's signaturely large military police units that was rebranded to a field division, the changelings of this unit were forever marked by their early days as soldiers, when they made up for their lack of training with a brutality that had been acceptable against anti-government activists yet was thorougly banned against the armies of the nations the changeling state wanted to rule peacefully. In time, they learned how to fight properly, but by then they had infamy... and a tradition."
SEV_14th_div:0 "14th "Ein Verdammte Schneeflocke" Division"
SEV_14th_div_desc:0 "Stormtroopers with some support companies.\n\nEmblem: Hexagon\n\nDrawn from the entire nation, this division, made up primarily of the herding class, was supposed to be forest specialists first rather than urban or fort specialists who were given extra training to be somewhat adept in woodland. Results were disappointing, with no real benefit compared to the normal Jager and Storm Team programs, and the division was constantly implicated for disobeying orders to not eat prisoners, but it was competent enough that it survived the war as an organization."
SEV_18th_div:0 "18th "Fanatiker" Division"
SEV_18th_div_desc:0 "Medium armor with mechanized and support SPAA.\n\nEmblem: Astrological H\n\nOf the Vhy's divisions, the 18th is quite possibly the most ideologically motivated. Slavishly loyal to Queen Chrysalis, this division, many of whom were drawn from the Chrysalis Youth, are consequently the most chivalrous to their enemies. However, they also have gotten into shooting conflicts with their own allies for "insufficient zeal", and famously once saw the soldiers execute a Lieutenant for cowardice for ordering a retreat in spite of the high command."
SEV_25th_div:0 "25th "Wotan" Brigade"
SEV_25th_div_desc:0 "Infantry with artillery.\n\nEmblem: Eight-Legged Changeling\n\nDespite starting out as a brigade within the 15th "Stahlschwarm", the 25th Brigade was split off as its own entity to defend occupied coastland. While there, it soon found itself fending off an Equestrian offensive, which it managed by conscripting the local pegasi to create the ideal winds for an attack by fire that proved decisive. The commander was awarded handsomely for defending the town against six times as many soldiers on short notice, but the brutal methods secretly gained him another kind of attention."
SEV_28th_div:0 "28th "Princip" Brigade"
SEV_28th_div_desc:0 "Infantry with engineers.\n\nEmblem: Olenian Flag\n\nNo single unit within the Changeling Armed Forces has managed to be so grotesque yet so long-lived as the "Princip" Brigade. Formed in Olenia when a desperate governor conscripted the local prison population to aid in the defence of his region, they quickly defected to the Heer, who constantly shuffled them around to keep anyone from noticing that they were absolutely useless at everything and were mostly an alternate death sentance for Olenians. They have now been passed on to the Vhy specifically so that they could be sent to Severyana."
SEV_31st_div:0 "31st Vhy "Vril" Division"
SEV_31st_div_desc:0 "Massed MBT's with mechanized.\n\nEmblem: Two V's Stacked Vertically\n\nIn the Fatherland, the Vhy continued to build bigger and better tanks. The better tanks went to the 31st, a battalion designed for testing large unit tactics with the new generation of armor, which was singularly versatile. Before and during the Veteran's Revolt, it was expanded repeatedly until it was a full-sized division. As a unit featured in much propaganda, it became unusually vain, especially regarding its tanks. When they started using the vehicles for executions via cannon and tread, it was removed from the front until being sent to Severyana."
SEV_40th_div:0 "40th Vhy "Stay Away" Division"
SEV_40th_div_desc:0 "Mountaineers with infantry.\n\nEmblem: Exclamation Point\n\nThroughout the years, many groups have tried to turn the Dennites of the far north into a fighting force. In theory, having no fear of death nor hesitance to kill others would make for an ideal soldier. The Vhy's attempt might have been the most succesful ever: In six months of campaigning, only 10% of the unit was killed by friendly fire. It has since been expanded from a brigade to a division, but the low population density of the Dennites has meant that we have filled the ranks with non-Dennites who work alongside them. Why it wasn't disposed of or taken back north and disbanded is a strange question, but now it is here."
SEV_42nd_div:0 "42nd Vhy "Fallschirmpanzer" Brigade"
SEV_42nd_div_desc:0 "Paratroopers with armor support.\n\nEmblem: Shooting Star\n\nProject Meteor should never have been funded, but it was, and inexplicably, it produced results. Not the ones hoped for, but being able to drop a heavy tank from a plane is a feat regardless of its armament. It's just a shame that the unit which makes use of this tech is one which treats every battle as if it's its last. Rarely an operation went by where some element of the 42nd didn't go rogue and do something illegal in order to try and get an extra advantage. Still, they shouldn't be underestimated."
SEV_dr_div:0 "Saturn Task Unit 'Todesstrahltrager'"
SEV_dr_div_desc:0 "Magic infantry with rockets.\n\nEmblem: N/A\n\nDuring the Veteran's Revolt, the largest magical equipment factory on the continent fell under siege by rebel forces. However, by linking up with allies and using their magical weapons to annihilate any area that the enemies were using, the facility's security staff held out and even went on the offensive. After retaking a shipment of rocket artillery and soldiers that had been captured by rebels, it became a full-fledged brigade, and when it was rescued, it had so much heavy equipment at its disposal that it was declared a divison and expanded."
SEV_heer_9th_div:0 "9th Panzer-Attacker Division 'Nera In Niyro'"
SEV_heer_9th_div_desc:0 "Magical mechanized led by superheavy tanks.\n\nEmblem: Fish on a Spear\n\nThe idea behind the formation of the 9th Panzer-Attacker division was to concentrate as much power in a small place as possible to not only force the enemy to retreat, but to destroy them in the first battle. The error, however, was allowing Trimmel to build all of it himself. The resultant division was as strong as was hoped, but was over-reliant on massed firepower as a solution. Despite its strength, or rather because of it, it was completely uneconomical at best, and at worst a danger to everything around it. It was also the first Heer division to be sent to Severyana."
SEV_militia:0 "Prandialist Militia"
SEV_militia_desc:0 "Infantry with motorized and some AA.\n\nEmblem: N/A\n\nMilitias created from whatever is available is a staple of the Prandialist way of warfare, which generally advises against direct confrontation and instead encourages demographic victories. Still, they can be thrown against real opponents if they have to be, and sometimes they even win. They come in all shapes and sizes, but they most commonly have some personal vehicles integrated into the force, as well as infiltration experts and heavy weapons."
SEV_inf_div:0 "Prandialist Unification"
SEV_inf_div_desc:0 "Infantry.\n\nEmblem: N/A\n\nMass mobilization is the cornerstone of Prandialist philosophy, and no entity depicts this better than "Unifications", their answer to divisions. These ad-hoc formations of barely-trained assemblies, one step above an especially lively riot, are the massive bodies used as the attacking force when an entire district isn't behaving how the Prandialist collective desires. Of course, when you have an army made out of whover showed up, you take what you can get."
SEV_inf_div_2:0 "Prandialist Swarm"
SEV_inf_div_desc_2:0 "Infantry.\n\nEmblem: N/A\n\nWhile the Prandialists theoretically only feel the need to take orders from the collective will, in practice, demagogues and experts hold a lot of sway. When you have a lot of military veterans in a small place, they can call their friends and concentrate force by bringing the best of the best into one specific group. These 'Swarms' differ from the traditional Unification band by being well-organized enough to have support units and elite sections, although they're rarely as large in terms of pure bodies."
SEV_inf_div_mid:0 "Prandialist Strike"
SEV_inf_div_mid_desc:0 "Infantry.\n\nEmblem: N/A\n\nDeep in the Prandialist culture are memories of the first waves of revolution. Revolting changelings would erect barricades, stop work, seize heavy weapons from the armories, and prepare to batter down the palace's grand doors. This tradition lives on, with 'Strikes' being the traditional name for paramilitary militias who are expected to defend against a concerted attack with shot and shell as much as with tooth and blade."

SEV_the_tower_desc:0 "Ichorograd grows ever larger, as does its population. Every day, it expands outwards and upwards, displacing entire city blocks and centralizing the metropolis into one megastructure. Yet the city was already nearing the limit on how much it could efficiently use its space, and as the great grey monument increases in size and swallows up every resource the region can offer, parts of the city's industry are finding better results elsewhere."

White Equalist fighters will raid every known partisan stronghold and force every terrorist into the open, where the changeling's heavy weapons can make short work of them. Then, we fill the power vacuum with our own comrades."
