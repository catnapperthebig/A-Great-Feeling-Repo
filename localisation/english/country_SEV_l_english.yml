sev_dual_administration:0 "Dual Administration"
sev_dual_administration_desc:0 "The Severyanan Protectorate (or Severyanan Exclusion Zone to those outside it) is a region split between two factions, both of whom have a disdain for each other matched only by their disdain for the local ponies.\n\nOn the right side of the nation, covering the coastline and a stretch of land that reaches to the capital city, are the territories held by parts of the Vhy, a pro-Imperial extremist organization. They are led by Kommandant Rosin Lyctia, a visionary biolinguist and personal friend of Captain Dieter Heinrich himself, who is the tyrant of the army that he must turn into a government.\n\nOn the other side, Prandialists own most of the interior land, and they plunder it as is convenient. They are represented by Urbiates orn Marks, who wields significant influence through his personal popularity while also being someone who the Vhy can communicate with consistently."

sev_council_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: Indeterminate\n§YRank§!: High\n§YBiography§!: The Prandialists traditionally do not recognize dedicated officers within their hierarchy. Certain individuals do seem to gravitate towards leading roles, but their authority is never considered higher than that of the masses around them. "Councils" are the true wielders of power and legitimacy in Prandialist society. Councils are created around pre-existing communities, usually single hives but sometimes smaller units like districts or larger units like regions or even the entire Prandialist sphere. They make every decision that needs to be made, from drudgery like taxation to more kinetic matters like warfare. A military campaign may be organized by a council with a voting population that includes everyone from the lowliest foot soldier to the most respected dancer to your travelling cousin who is writing in by mail.\nDespite being faceless masses, councils do still seem to have personalities, memories, quirks, and other features of more traditional leaders. Some are better at managing internal politics, others at waging war, and a few are just plain barbarous."

sev_utan:0 "Clypeus "Utan" Kladisum"
sev_utan_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 17 May, 965 in Kladisium\n§YRank§!: Generalmajor\n§YBiography§!: Little is known about Utan's life before the military. They aren't prone to sharing details casually, and they didn't legally exist until the 7th Blodtruppen stumbled across them in Equestria. They recruited him into their ranks in a series of events which won't be repeated for time, but suffice it to say that the arrest warrants are public records. Ever since, he's been travelling with the 7th as an officer, possibly against his will, and that he may be a descendant of an old monarchic lineage who's hive was destroyed centuries ago, but that can't be confirmed since the prandialists burned the archives in 855.\nThat said, the gross incompetence that tends to follow the 7th apparently burnt itself out on him when he was recruited, making him a trusty commander, at least compared to his peers. Over the war, he was promoted many times. When the Vhy divisions of Severyana arrived and found themselves poaching any possible staff they could find to run their logistics and other resource needs, Utan got one more boost to Generalmajor.\n§YPortrait By§!: Opal Radiance"

sev_oldman:0 "Gerentor Lyctia"
sev_oldman_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 14 August, 927 in Lyctida\n§YRank§!: Generaloberst\n§YBiography§!: In the Changeling Lands, disdain for the foreign nation is normal, but disdain for the foreigner is not. After all, their distrust of the changelings is rational and reasonable, and if that is understandable then what else about them is simply a difference of opinion?\nGerentor has never agreed with this. He wasn't nearly left-leaning enough to join the Prandialists, although they would have loved to have him, but by the Queen did he not like those ponies. For him, the Vhy was a group that could finally represent his views. He has been a loyal follower ever since he discovered them.\nFrom his beginnings as an officer in the Lyctidan Army to now, his military career has become longer than most lives. For his loyalty, experience, and skill, he has now found himself as the head of the Vhy's land forces in the Zone. Bizarrely, although he's never had issues adjusting to a new position, he still hasn't stopped behaving like this promotion came last week.\n§YPortrait By§!: Triplesevens"

sev_shorthouse_publishing:0 "Short-House Publishing"
sev_shorthouse_publishing_desc:0 "Formed nearly a century ago, Short-House Publishing is the oldest known non-Royal publishing company from the Changeling Lands. They specialize in serial printings, such as the "New Machinery Quarterly", a magazine for industrial workers and managers, and "How to Kill", a monthly publication popular with everyone from beat cops and hoof-infantry around the continent to Fallschirmjaegers and even some VOPS operatives.\nTheir most prolific series, however, and by far their most controversial, is "Handicapped Grandpa Weekly", a magazine combining signal/radio hobbyism, erotica, and that peculiar changelingish form of left-wing politics which seems to equate authenticity with intellectual merit and illiteracy with charm. Urbiates orn Marks is a favorite recurring contributor, as are Proletarii the anti-Marksist-Stallionst satire persona and Endophal the pornographic cartoon artist.\nIn the Changeling Lands, owning an issue of Handicapped Grandpa can result in up to two years in prison. Nearly all of the employees of Short-House Publishing were exiled to the Severyana Exclusion Zone for their Prandialist politics, and thus the company is now based there."

SEV_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Early Changeling designs for bolt-action rifles were often confused and unreliable. The Karabiner 98, along with the rest of the project to create an infantry loadout to Dieter's design, wound up being the first to work well when properly mass-produced. The rifle would be the mainstay of the Heer until the end of the war."

SEV_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "Dieter's plans proved to be a good blueprint, but they weren't designed with any normal race in mind. Modifications to the infantryman's kit to take advantage of new discoveries quickly found themelves in order, and the Changeling military obsession with grenades began to appear."

SEV_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The MP-80 project, unexpectedly, was one of the first new-generation Changeling firearms completed, being that Dieter already had a working model to pattern off of. Finding their place in the doctrine, however, took much longer, as Changeling officers didn't trust the diminutive cartridge at first, but it would eventually become the most iconic Changeling weapon of the war."

SEV_infantry_equipment_x_desc:0 "The most mature Changeling infantry loadout came in 1019, during the Second Hearthswarming Crisis, where, at the height of their power, the Second Wehrmacht gave this rifle to certain high-value units. Underbarrel attachments were very common in this pattern, which made it expensive."

The Power Cracker was an evolution on that design, most notable for having an engine instead of holes in the floor. It never saw use before the Panzers became dominant."

SEV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_short:0 "Sturmtiger"
SEV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Sturmtiger was a siege mortar built into a Tiger hull. Despite this being an offensive weapon made during a defensive war, it made a name for itself in the Major Offensive. By day, the armor protected them from counterbatteries, and by night, the job was done by the ghostly wails coming from the barrel when the breach was left open and the crew inside snored, which caused attacking ponies to retreat out of fear."
SEV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3:0 "Geschützwagen Tiger"
SEV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "Based on the hull of a King Tiger, it was to be able to mount a 170mm K 72 L/50 gun. However, the sole prototype built was destroyed when it was used as cover when the factory designing it fell under attack."

Although it was intended to be the main gun, it could still be pitched up, and this was its most useful configuration. The nickname came from the open top of the long, now-flat design."

SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "Linebreaker"
SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Linebreaker program was a series of prototypes designed to combine Dieter's high-mobility armored assault strategy with a more old-styled focus on special high-energy designs. However, magic and industry function on different rules, and the resulting designs were scrapped for being unable to do anything extremely well and being horribly expensive."

SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger"
SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Tiger I was a Changeling heavy tank developed in 1012 as an answer to the unexpectedly impressive Stalliongradian armour encountered in the initial months of the Changeling invasion of the Equestria, particularly the T-34 and the KV-1. To this end, it did its job masterfully whenever it wasn't suffering some sort of technical issue, which it usually was."

SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Known under the informal name 'Trnir-Tiger' but, often semi-literally translated as the Bigger Tiger by Equestrian soldiers, the Tiger II combined the thick armour of the Tiger I with the sloped armour used on the Panther medium tank. The tank weighed almost seventy metric tons, and was the first to use Thaumatic Sabot rounds, making it able of penetrating nearly anything."

SEV_light_tank_equipment_1:0 "Panzerkampfwagen I"
SEV_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Panzer I was a light tank produced in Changeling Lands in the 1000's, and the first of many tanks to have Dieter's influence. Design of the Panzer I began in 1005 and some production began in 1006. Intended only as a training tank to introduce the concept of armoured warfare to the Changeling Heer, the PzKpfw I found use anyways as a stopgap until more advanced tanks could be produced."
SEV_light_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Panzer I"
SEV_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen II"
SEV_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Panzer II was originally designed as a second stopgap, but was found to be capable enough to function as a frontline tank, and thus entered mass production regardless. A number of issues caused by immature doctrine were pre-empted and solved, and then a whole host of new ones were added because the nation had started mass-producing cars within the last decade and this was much more complicated."

SEV_light_tank_equipment_3:0 "VK 1602 Leopard"
SEV_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The VK1602 Leopard was a planned Changeling reconnaissance vehicle designed in 1012. However, what was turned in was an armored car with a rocket launcher taped to the top as a protest against severe budget cuts. This proved to be more economical, so the design was accepted, causing the director to go mad and light the blueprints on fire. This is not that design."

It was developed in 1012 as a successor to the earlier Flakpanzer IV. The Panzer IV's turret was removed and replaced with an open-top, hexagonal turret which housed a 3.7 cm FlaK 43. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but this was not possible due to the heavy smoke generated by the gun."

They were popular in Panzer divisions fighting in rough terrain. The name comes from the fact that the radiator was replaced with a smaller, cheaper version, not realizing the weight wasn't much different from the normal chassis.

It was intended as a counter to the Stalliongradian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside the heavier Tiger tank. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks ever created."

SEV_gw_armored_car_equipment_desc:0 "Changelings were an early adopter of armored cars, finding that they were a cheap way to handle riots and rebels alike. With Dieter's doctrinal assistance, a pattern that was easily mass-produced and used in standard conflict was designed quickly."

SEV_armored_car_equipment_1_desc:0 "The needs of the Changeling's wars proved that there was more to armored cars than armor on a car. Thus, they began to pick apart the versions Dieter had described to try and figure why each component was how it was. The Dira-Milriar 7 was the result."

SEV_armored_car_equipment_2_short:0 "Warthog"
SEV_armored_car_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Dira-Milriar 10 was a response that paralleled the one Dieter described, where the small machine gun was being stopped by basic fortifications and simple armor. Thus an armored car with a vastly larger main gun. The name 'Warthog' was chosen for its towhooks and rough driving, and because it was not the standard to name vehicles after mythological creatures such as the suggested one."

Still able to handle light units reasonably well, but also able to be a thorn in the side of amored units, these things would end up built by the hundred."

SEV_magical_equipment_1_short:0 "K-10"
SEV_magical_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Changeling's first attempt at a magic weapon was, predictably, an unusual attempt. Rather than trying to launch spells, or bolts of concentrated mana, the T-10 used magical impulse to create directed arcs of lightning. However, this version suffered issues, such as sustained fire causing the entire thing to melt, serious distance issues with accuracy and power, and the need for eye protection."

SEV_magical_equipment_2_short:0 "EK-13"
SEV_magical_equipment_2_desc:0 "The TEK-13 was much more stable than its predecessor. The melting problem was grealy lessened, and by pumping more power into it more efficiently, the effective range increased as well. Of note was the selector switch, or 'fun button', that allowed continuous fire for anti-vehicle use."

SEV_magical_equipment_3_short:0 "TEK-19"
SEV_magical_equipment_3_desc:0 "The TEK-19 was the version that started making waves. Minaturization allowed for in-built thaumatic braiding, greatly increasing the stability over range, while 'continuous' mode was replaced with 'flicker', which was much more sustainable. The other effect of thaumatic braiding, light inversion, was also present, which necessitated yet more special eye protection but looked beautiful on camera."

SEV_magical_equipment_4_desc:0 "The TREK-25 was the pinnacle of magical weapons in the Changeling Lands for a very long time. Due to their use of electricity, previous iterations could be nullfiied by Fair Day meshes, which were so easy to work with that they could even be used as personal armor. This model had a magical sorting mechanism to allow it to only aim at 'animated' things, meaning living beings, but also vehicles."

Between the two, miles of land and an inch of protective glass.\nNearly a dozen scientists and engineers were watching, but they didn't get to push the custom-made giant red button with a skull painted on it. The head theoretician hung up his phone just as a buzzer went off, and said, "We are go for operations. Start when ready." Before he could finish saying the last sentence, the Queen slammed down on the button with all her might, causing a brilliant teal flash from the tower.\nThe theoretician was torn between concern at the spectacular size of the weapon's effect, and the fact that the Queen was staring at it, jaw hanging open limply in adoration. Such a massive explosion, such a noise - and it left behind a poison that her own changelings were nearly immune to. It was perfect."

With three implacable evils turning on one another, the thinking went that the forces of right couldn't help but win.\n\nUnfortunately, what came next was not so simple as that idealized world.\n\nIf you wish to try to change the fate of the Severyana Exclusion Zone, for better or for worse, you may. Be warned, however, that what awaits shall be misery, barbarism, zealotry, and more gore than four score Great Wars. There is no shame in staying on the kinder side of the border, that you may smother your child in its sleep when the time is right.

severyana_a.1.d:0 "Doctor Rosin R. Lyctia, PhD. in Biolinguistics, recipient of the 1003 Queen's Highest Excellence in Progress award for his work both discovering and unraveling Greneclyfian, former Generalmajor of the 3rd "Lyctidia" division and current Kommandant of all Vhy personnel in the Severyana Protectorate, looked out the window of his new thirteenth-floor office, once of the most significant rooms in the world, and wished he was home.\n\nIt wasn't the fact that now he was working with Prandialists so closely that Stalliongrad was split between the two factions, although he wasn't a fan. It wasn't the noise outside his office, as construction workers added new walls where the Palace of the Soviets was bisected by the lines on the map. It wasn't the fact that he was in the Palace of the Soviets at all, in the office which used to belong to the General Secretary and hadn't been completely picked clean. It was that he wasn't sure why he was in charge of a nation. All he knew was that he had been chosen by the Queen, apparently personally, and had to make do.\n\nOutside his window was Stalliongrad, although the name was already on the path to being changed, like the city itself. It had been torn apart by its conquest, and the Prandialists, barbarians as usual, were keeping it in pieces. The only reason the gunfire had stopped was that they had started to find shooting boring. Supposedly, part of his job was keeping them restrained and in this country, but he didn't have a clue how. At least he had time to figure it out.\n\nHis idle wondering was interrupted by the tremendous crash of a changeling on a chair falling through the ceiling. It was Urbiates, his liaison wit the Prandialists, who was lying on the floor in pain. "It's not bolted to the floor, Urbiates... It just needs some convincing, Urbiates..." He groaned. "Oh, hey, Rosin." He continued."

We're just figuring our way around this place."\n\nRosin didn't bother to get out of his chair. "It's 'Kommandant' Rosin. What the hell are you wearing?"\n\nUrbiates grasped at his coat. "Oh, we found this upstairs. Apparently it's from Bronze Hill, wherever that is. I just think it fits our branding. Look, it's even got our symbol! Kind of! And since I'm here... Hey, Octy! That guy I was telling you about is down here!"\n\nA smaller changeling wearing a stolen Red Army uniform floated down through the hole. "The gay one?"\n\n"Yeah, that one." Urbiates shook like a dog, causing pieces of plaster to fall out of his jacket.\n\n'Octy' landed and held his hoof out over the desk. "Octopxhbin, at your service. Got to ask, did it hurt when you fell out of someone's ass?"\n\nRosin stared at him. "Charmed. Did it hurt when you got deported from your own home country?"\n\nOcty looked confused. "I... wait, how did you know about that?"\n\n"You do a remarkable job hiding your Greneclyfian accent considering you don't hide your name, but I can still make out your dennite drawl on top of it, and I can put two and two together. Now get out of here, I have actual work to do." Rosin explained.\n\n"Alright, if you insist. Have a good day, comrade budski." Urbiates said as he left through the office's front door. Octy followed, sticking his tongue out at Rosin. Then the office is as it was, barring the debris in the center and the hole in the ceiling.\n\nThe thing he wanted to do least was deal with those two, but he had to. Urbiates was the only Prandialist of note who he could regularly communicate with, which had always been the case, and neither faction could subdue the entirety of Severyana on their own. If he couldn't live with them, they would all die without them."

severyana_a.3.d:0 "The Protectorate was still new, and new creatures were still coming in all the time. Normally, they spent a while having a place for them found by the bureaucracy in and around the Palace, which already had the upper ranks filled. As such, they were usually abstract to Rosin, high in the thirteenth floor Kommandant's office. If they weren't, they would simply appear in his area. It's why it was actually fairly unusual that someone got fast-tracked high enough up the ranks that he appeared in that very office. But there he was, saying "Unterkapitan Jenom, at your service, sir."\n\nRosin put down the set of papers detailing the rest of the continent's goings-on. "Oh? Who are you?"\n\n"Unterkapitan Jenom, sir." The other changeling replied. He was a royal, tall and proud and with their long hair in a bright red.\n\nRosin barely kept the annoyance off his face. "I heard you the first time, I'm asking why you were told to see me directly."\n\nSitting in the seat across the desk and adopting a terrible posture, Jenom replied, "I'm the one who was organizing anti-partisan activities in the Southern region until it was given independence. Now that they have their own structures for it, I've been sent here to assist your own counter-terror dealings." He pulled out a toothpick and started cleaning between his teeth. "I think you'll find that I was very effective."\n\nRosin decided to not mention that the article he had been reading was on a changeling governor in the Southern Protectorate who had been tortured to death by their biggest domestic rebel group last week. It must have fallen apart very quickly without Jenom's intervention. "Well, I'm glad to have you, Unterkapitan. I'll get you placed in charge of counter-terror operations, and find an office for you."\n\nJenom grinned. "This will be the beginning of a very productive relationship. Trust me.""

She'll keep you safe, she'll keep you informed, and she can't be replaced, so if you can't protect her you need to send her back to us!"\n\n"Okay! What is she?" Rosin yelled back, barely able to hear himself think.\n\n"She's a reader! She reads other creatures! That's why we need her back, so also send her over if you don't need her anymore!" The officer explained. His hat nearly blew off in the wind.\n\n"I don't know what a reader is! Can you have the pilot turn the engine off so that we can talk in peace? I can't hear myself think!" Rosin replied.\n\n"No, it's fine, we'll be out of here in a second!" The officer shouted back. "The most important part is that she can tell when a changeling is disguised just by being within the same room! That's such a big deal that if the airport here ever takes damage, you need to get her to a different town so that it won't stop her from being able to leave!" He turned and got back onto the stairs up to the passenger compartment. The submachinegun-armed guard who had been watching got out of his way as he turned around to finally yell, "She can describe how it works better! Just don't get her killed because we'll want her back at some point!"\n\nAs he closed the door and the propellers spun up, Rosin waved a guard over, and the two pulled the confused blind girl away from the plane that was already moving to the runway to take off again. He already wished that they had taken the time to explain what exactly they had dropped on him as support, since he had it in his grasp and he knew barely more than last week when he was told "someone is being sent over". How could that officer possibly be so time-constrained that he couldn't even stay that long, he wondered."

It was not easing his mind that this tiny thing wore the dull grey coat of a common worker. The backseat of the staff car was the first place where they could talk without hurting her ability to navigate, and he decided to use it. "What's your name, miss?"\n\n"My name is Tarea, Tarea Sor. What about you?" She asked back, looking ahead flatly.\n\n"I'm Kommandant Rosin Lyctia." He replied, worried that she didn't know. "You're in the Severyan Protectorate. You've been given to us to help deal with the Prandialists."\n\n"Oh..." She replied sadly. "I was hoping I was somewhere else."\n\n"It's fine," Rosin explained. "You'll be given the best accommodations we can without risking your safety. You'll probably live a wealthier life here than wherever you are from. Can you tell me about yourself? The Queen seems to think you're very valuable."\n\nTarea paused. "Well, I'm a reader. I can see beings, and I can... well, I can see them when they're behind something that doesn't hide them." She looked at him, or at least in his direction as she was still wearing the blindfold. "I can see that you're there, but I can't see your face, or your eyes, just your existence. And if you were disguised, I'd see that, too, like a sheet over a piece of furniture. Before you ask, I don't know what's under the sheet, just that it's covering something. I can't tell existences apart, you and the guard and the driver look the same to me."\n\nRosin exhaled. "Well, that still kind of is a big deal. Color me impressed. Is there anything else?"\n\n"Yeah." She began. "As part of my enchantment, I'm not allowed to see violence, wear black, or have anything but water on the eighth day of the Royal week. Those shouldn't be hard for you, though."\n\nThe car pulled into the underground garage of the Palace. "We can manage," Rosin said, wondering how she survived without black."

Rosin annoyedly replied.\n\n"Yours, or your wife's?" Urbiates asked.\n\n"Mine. Her parents were friends of mine, and they died, so I've taken her in. It's the right thing to do, although I know that concept gives you trouble." Rosin lied.\n\nUrbiates mimed wiping a tear from his eye. "How touching. Anyways, we came to say that we've found a weird thing and we want you to have it because we're too lazy to take it apart." A collection of pictures fell onto the table, along with a stained napkin with an address written on it.\n\nRosin picked up one of the photos and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was at least fifty percent useful information. It was some sort of brick oval in the middle of a warehouse, covered in warnings. Naturally, Octy was licking it in the picture. "That is interesting, actually. I'll send a team out."\n\n"That's all we have for now, I'm glad to say." Urbiates finished. He handed a note to Tarea and whispered, "call me" before leaving.\n\nOnce the door was closed for a bit, Rosin asked, "So, did you see anything?"\n\n"The one who did all the talking, I don't know who he was, but it wasn't who you saw." She whispered. She turned her head down to her hoof, which had his note in it. "Also, did he think I could read this?"

severyana_a.7.d:0 "In front of Rosin, a line of ponies stood dull and senseless. Sometimes they stepped forwards. The one at the front sometimes received a loaf of bread from the one behind the table and left the line, the life flowing back into them now that they could resume their day. Two black-clad Vhy soldiers stood watch, in case anyone thought that they could make one right move and drag away a week's worth of food, Prandialists included. It was a common sight in the urban areas, and had been ever since the famine.\n\n"It's actually things like this that are the big question," the scrawny changeling continued. "Every pony has an opinion on whether we should maintain the Stalliongradian state-controlled economy or allow for individual entrepreneurship. It's fairly split."\n\n"I can imagine. What do you recommend?" Rosin asked.\n\n"Don't do it, if we control the economy then we control the entire country. Even the parts owned by the Prandialists." Jenom chimed in. "We won't be able to enforce anything under a free market. We won't even know who to call."\n\n"Well, sort of." The other changeling cleaned his glasses against his coat. "But there are ways to control even the freest market. We'd know who was rich, obviously. The major benefit is that we wouldn't have to maintain anything ourselves if we didn't have a reason to. We can always undo it later if some field demands it, too."\n\nRosin rubbed his chin. Another pony shuffled out of the line. Every one of them wasn't working, yet they were still maintaining themselves. It was inefficient, but that wasn't bad. If they had to fix it, they'd find a better way, but Rosin wasn't sure that his state could keep track of who held power and who didn't... or that they could keep the system running if they ran it themselves."

His friends in the benches and seats were nearly all officers who were busy looking sheepish. "So? Does anyone want to explain why nobody thought this was important?" Most of the room was trying to avoid looking at him. "The fatherland hasn't sent us food since we arrived and nobody thought to mention that? Come on. Have our soldiers even been eating?"\n\n"It's not a critical issue yet," yelled one of the officers. "We have plenty of love, and the ponies we got it from are still made of meat. We can eat them."\n\nRosin pressed his hoof into his face. "We are building our new order, here! We are not eating our future workforce when we could just make them catch fish!"\n\nAnother officer spoke up. "We're already instituting fish catching and farming programs, it will just take a year before they can sustainably feed us."\n\n"Okay!" Rosin shouted. "So it's not a total disaster. What can we do to keep our armies fed for one year? Suggestions?"\n\nJenom stood up. "Our work camp program is proceeding well. Soon it will begin to suffer the planned attrition. If we increase the processing rate, we can sustain ourselves off of the dead prisoners and increase productivity."\n\nIvl Meknasti also stood up. "We don't need to boost our bodycount just to make our ends meet! We already process a substantial number of ponies through our normal anti-partisan activities. In our raids and especially executions, we can merely collect the bodies and use those as our extra food." Meknasti puffed out his chest with pride. "It would even boost morale in the field if our soldiers knew that they were catching their own food on such operations, which are dreary and soul-crushing otherwise."\n\nTwo good solutions, as far as Rosin was concerned."

Portions of it had been covered in engraved metal sheets to hide names from the Stalliongradian government that built the facility. Rosin had to tip his hat to the Marksists, they knew how to get rid of the folks they didn't like. It was a shame their biology didn't let them use every part of the malfeasant.\n\nDeltapolis, like many similar facilities, was being converted so that the inmates' processing didn't end with them being worked to death. When they became too exhausted to continue, they would be taken into a side chamber, exposed to a lethal dosage of gas, and mechanically drained of love before being sent to the corpse pit. If needed, the gas could be washed off the meat and that could also be consumed. The purpose of Rosin's visit was to arrive shortly before the extra sections were activated.\n\nHis car arrived just behind a new group of prisoners, from unemployed bums to partisans. The prison owner met him and led him to a raised balcony where much of the complex of trenches and mines could be seen. "Inmates of Vorkuta, now called Deltapolis!" He called out. Some prisoners stopped and looked at the new voice, and as they were not beaten by the guards for it, more joined them. "I have come to you with an offer! Many of you have been scorned by your old masters, and new service under the Vhy for the good of the Severyanan Protectorate is an ample way to not only avenge yourself but to crawl out of this hole!" By now, nearly all eyes were on him. "Those of you who wish to come with me, simply step forward!"\n\nThe prisoners stared. Then they looked at each other, and to the prisoners on their other side. There was a bit of murmuring, and the biggest one drove his pick back into the dirt, and soon every one was back to work.\n\nOh well. If they regretted it, they would only do so for a year or two."

He'd always meant to look up the historical context, how someone thought a method of execution that played into all the worst aspects of creaturedom and then applied it so liberally it became a concept, but never had the time, and now it felt like he never would.

Rosin still couldn't believe that he and his loyal soldiers were essentially sole rulers of the entire nation, despite his official stance. He was feeling hopeful for the first time in a while. Jenom continued, "It was slow-going, but I think we've finally figured the best way to get these things to interact with us peacefully. They've been turning in rebels whenever they crop up, and there hasn't been any partisan activity at all." As Rosin looked around at the village, he saw ponies going about their lives normally like they had been ordered to, and saw a sign of peace.\n\nIt was short-lived. There were the sounds of a struggle behind him, and when he turned around, he saw his guards pinning down an oddly-dressed pony. She was wearing a mixture of military equipment from both the Red Army and the Vhy, while her clothes turned out to be rough work clothes dyed into earthen colors. Jenom began screaming for her death, but Rosin looked at him and the message was sent. "You're not a partisan, are you?" Rosin asked, stooping down to get closer to the pony's ground-based eye level.\n\n"No." The pony replied, strained under the weight of two changelings.\n\n"Then what are you?" He asked further.\n\n"Isn't it obvious? I'm a stalker." She declared as best as she could. Rosin motioned for the guards to let her stand up, and after shaking the biggest pieces of dirt off, she continued. "The last couple decades have been a parade of our fellow northerners hiding their wealth before flying or dying. Folks like me are tracking it down."\n\n"And the guns?" Rosin asked. She was armed with a pistol and a rifle, more than most soldiers.\n\n"Isn't it obvious? It's not just the family silverware. Some of us have found bars of gold, originals of masterpiece paintings, the like." She explained.\n\n"Sir, we can't let armed grave robbers walk around the country unimpeded." Jenom stated.

The rest of the room was soon to follow, but for now, business called. "Are there any concerns regarding this proposal?" Rosin asked the small crowd, still only filling around a third of the seats. The proposal in question was to petition the [CHN.GetName] to allow normal changelings across the border in order to help make up for the current lack of numbers.\n\nThere was a mumble throughout the crowd, but none spoke up before it all fell silent. "Alright, then. It shall be sent as-is." He felt some pride that the state had come this far, but here he was. The Severyana Protectorate was the most dangerous region, and he had turned it around into one where at least some of it was ready to become more living room.\n\n\n\nIchorograd was looking nicer than ever from his office when he got the news that his proposal had been accepted by Queen Chrysalis.

They had trucks or cars filled with luggage, and were brought by promises of a new life in a new land. Rosin had to see it for himself, and made some time for a trip. The first batch was now assembled in front of him, some looking on with varying levels of surprise that the Kommandant himself was welcoming them. Rosin was also surprised, as the sum of the program's immigrants were so far not even a dozen households. Of those, most weren't even families, just one adult travelling alone.\n\n"Welcome to [Root.Getname], comrades. As the first of the new wave of settlers to our race's newest frontier, I felt it best to personally welcome you. Sadly, I am very busy, and cannot stay long, but rest assured that my primary goal will be to get you and those who come after you comfortable and prosperous in this new land."  He stepped down from the rock he had been standing on and began to shake hooves with the immigrants. He wished he had brought a camera crew, he probably looked very official doing this. Once a few questions were answered, and a few greetings were said, he peeled off to go back to his business.\n\n"What do you think of that?" He asked the denizens of his car, Jenom and Tarea.\n\nJenom grunted, but Tarea had seemed offput ever since she caught sight of the immigrants. "Why were half of them in disguise?" She asked.

We were separated to compartmentalize us from the Hegemony due to the risk of our failure, but look at us now."\n\nJenom sighed and leaned back. "I know, it's just... I kind of expected this to be a one-way trip, you know?"\n\nRosin smirked. "Come on, what kind of master race would we be if we couldn't even lord over a land who thought Celestia wasn't tyrannical enough?" Jenom smiled back. Rosin passed him the letter.

Meanwhile, the prospect of being able to go back to his own land far outweighed even the idea of them taking away his entire country.

Ichorograd's architecture was in a traditional Severyanan style, unless it had been dynamited to make way for mass-produced grey bricks that were a twisted parody of an equine city and a changeling hive in equal measure. What kind of changeling desired to live there, given the choice between another culture's pride and another culture's failed imitation? It would not do for the new changeling state.\n\nOne order later, and he could see it from his office. Trucks came and dropped off material at the Palace, which was now to be the spire of a hive, built inorganically in massive concrete segments until as much of the downtown area as possible was a densely-packed megastructure of stone on top of stone on top of packed ground on top of tunnels. It would not be large by hive standards, but it would be the most modern one yet. Everything from shops and apartments to heavy foundries, all in a fraction the area of the city it was replacing.\n\nThe Prandialists had agreed to allow his forces to singularly occupy the center of town for this project. From their perspective, it was a few acres of land that was overhunted anyways, and their own more traditional hive structure was far enough away to not interrupt. They had agreed amongst themselves that the Vhy had taken charge under their own power, and they were nearly tolerable now.\n\nRosin had never been an architect, but he could appreciate monumentality. So would the future of the nation."

severyana_a.35.d:0 ""Herr Meknasti, I am surprised at you." Rosin stated. He was sitting in a nearly-empty auditorium, staring up at a stage where a band was assembling instruments. He had been told that, as part of the new "Reichskunstkammer" initiative, he would be presiding over a special locally-grown music group and deciding personally whether to give them government support for their art as a publicity stunt… but he had not been told they were ponies.\n\n"Wait until you hear them." Ivl Meknasti replied from the chair to his right. "Solargrad is a group which I believe captures our racial spirit better than much of our own kind."\n\nJenom leaned in from the left and asked, "Solargrad? Really? I already know this is pony nonsense. Rosin, shut this down."\n\nRosin waved. He would see for himself, although his hopes weren't high. The band was dressed in identical dark grey clothes that gave them a paramilitary flair, and their pony instruments were mixed in with changeling ones. Meknasti gave the signal, and the band began to play. The singer's voice was deep and raspy, and the music was unlike anything he'd ever heard. The lyrics were in Griffonian, which only made him suspect pandering even more, but then he listened to them.\n\nVON REIZTECHNOLOGIE.\nVON ZEITOKONOMIE.\nVON QUALITAT DAS LEBENS.\nUND KRIEGSPHILOSOPHIE.\n\nWhen the song was done, he could barely think from the fact that it continued to pound in his ear. It was certain that many other changelings would like the music, but was it worth the risk that they would inject some sort of Equine degeneracy in later on? Even if it was, this culture initiative was supposed to increase the nation's prestige, and it was supposed to be by, of, and for changelings."

Rosin suggested annoyedly.\n\nJenom stuttered and stumbled around the room. He took a second to think about what he was going to say. "You're right, Kommandant. I'm sorry. We have found a distressing amount of Solargrad albums and other products in possession of partisans. We asked them why, but they say it's satire against our order."\n\n"That's… an interesting perspective." Rosin considered it. "I don't know how they figured that out, but we can't exactly take all the albums off the shelves for a band we've already publicly supported because others can't understand them."\n\n"Why not?" Jenom asked.\n\n"What do you mean ‘why not'? We've already told everyone they're acceptable, any change would be us publicly admitting wrong." Rosin explained patiently.

severyana_a.37.d:0 "To Rosin, taking off his coat was more than simply losing an article of clothing. It was part of his uniform, his persona as Kommandant, so if it wasn't warm enough he put another coat over it and if it was too warm then he simply suffered through it. Taking it off was something he usually did once per day, less in certain crisis situations. Once it was off, he would eat whatever his servants had prepared. He was too old to survive on junk food, and to get every minute of sleep he could, he ate so quickly that he scarcely tasted what he was actually putting inside him, so it was usually healthy but tasteless or worse. Then he would go straight to bed. In the morning he would have another meal that he didn't get any enjoyment from, put on an identical coat, and go straight back to the Palace.\n\nIt wasn't the worst living he'd ever had. His time in Griffonia had had some periods that were worse. Those had lasted weeks at most, however.\n\nIt struck him as very odd on this night that he didn't want to sleep, although he was in bed. He wanted to stay up and listen to Solargrad's first officially-released album, which was sitting on the dressed by the phonograph. He had been to the live performance last week, and many of the songs cried out to be listened to again. But he hardly got enough sleep as-is, how could he spend precious night hours listening to music?\n\nA number of other high officers were at that performance, and had received their own albums. Having some sort of media to bond with them over would make him a lot more palatable, he figured. He levitated the phone on his nightstand and dialed the Palace administration, and said that he would be three hours late tomorrow. That would give him some time to enjoy a meal and listen to some good music at the same time. Then he took a second look at the album in its cardboard sheath, and decided he was listening to it that very night."

Working with them hadn’t dulled Rosin’s hate for them and their ideas.\n\nUrbiates suddenly burst through the meeting room door, panting heavily. Octy followed him, wearing a guitar. “Sorry, we got held up at the station,” the former said as he stretched painfully and slumped down into one of the chairs. He breathed heavily and wiped the sweat from his brow. “Okay, so we... hah... We found some communities of ponies living in the Western mountains in self-made refugee camps. We’re planning on treating them as free food, but we wanted to check with you guys first.”\n\nRosin calmly replied, “We will think about it. First, I have some business I would like to attend to with your own faction.” He slid a bunch of documents over to them. “There are a couple personalities we think we can ‘convince’ to say nice things about our administration, first and foremost this celebrity, Woodie Chipper.”\n\n”No, this is more important. Those morons are getting self-sufficient and that means we’ll have to deal with them soon.” Urbiates stated.\n\n”It can be dealt with tomorrow, which my issue may not be because your goons killed him.” Rosin stated back forcefully.\n\n”I left the normal world behind and started living in/A hinterland between dissolution and self-discipline.” Rosin turned to the sound of the music and saw Octy singing and strumming his guitar. He was playing it left-hooved so it was upside down, and covered in blood, but Rosin could still see Woodie Chipper’s trademark sticker saying ‘THIS MACHINE KILLS SUPREMACISTS’. “I burned the midnight oil to build my way of seeing/A miner at the coal face of meaning.”\n\nUrbiates noticed him staring. “Yeah, he’s pretty good.

His chauffeurs were Octy and Urbiates, and he suspected that they were intentionally driving through the most threatening part of town possible, using a record player to blast music that was at once distant and alien, and aggressive and forceful. Even when he was trying to be friendly, they wouldn’t let him forget the hate they had for him.\n\nThe car passed by another cluster of corpses of ponies impaled on sharpened rebar stuck into the sidewalk. “REACTIONARY”, said the sign around one’s neck. “THIEF”, said another. A third was besides a dead changeling, who was labelled “ZOOPHILE”. The crimes were different, but there had been at least a dozen clusters he’d seen on the way in.\n\nIchorograd was short for a hive, which meant that it snuck up on Rosin, only barely taller than the buildings around it despite it being a sheer wall of stone. “Here we are,” Urbiates said. The gates to the city were large and currently symbolic, being a large opening rather than a door. Hanging from the frame were bundles of severed heads, some withered to skulls and others looking like they were fresh. “Welcome to Ichorograd, comrade budski,” he continued in a mocking tone. “I hope you enjoy the tour.”"

In spite of that, it was barbaric in every way. Large sections seemed either entirely unplanned or built to be properly designed later. The Severyanan and Stalliongradian architecture was not integrated into the superstructure as much as it was absorbed by it, causing architectural styles to clash monstrously. The pre-existing roads didn’t center on the hive itself, so the entire place was difficult to navigate unaided. It was like a parody of a hive.\n\nMost harrowing, in the place of cafeterias or restaurants, there were simply craters dug into the asphalt where ponies, many still alive and unharmed, were thrown to be consumed communally. The tour was punctuated by screams or cries or stray pools of blood as the denizens played with their food.\n\nRosin felt no shame in his sympathy. The ponies were lower creatures, but this was too far, he was sure of it. He didn’t dare say it for risk of offending his hosts. Even if they were trying to make him miserable, he needed them to at least thing he tried to be a good sport.\n\nThe last stop was dead center of the megastructure, and Rosin couldn’t believe his eyes. Stacked at least two stories tall was a monument built out of the discarded skulls of whatever the Prandialists could catch. At the top was a throne made out of ribs and spines. “Who is it for?” Rosin asked.\n\nSmirking, Urbiates simply answered, “Princess Celestia.”\n\n”Why did you build this?”\n\n”Come on, Rosin. Don’t tell me you don’t feel their power coursing through this hive. We have their skulls, we have their souls, great and pathetic alike, all chained to the will of our hive.” Urbiates explained. “It’s a fine spin on an ancient tradition, one which your precious Chrysalis tried to stamp out.”\n\n”Ah”, Rosin grunted."

Created to celebrate something or maybe because it seemed like a good idea at the time, it was the thematic opposite of the Equestrian Hearthswarming celebrations, with politically-active changelings going door to door with weapons and large sacks and demanding your valuables.\n\nLegally, you were supposed to resist. Practically, no one did, and the Vhy or police forces tracked down participants to kill them and wound up keeping much of the loot for themselves. It was a strange back-and-forth. From the rising pillars of smoke and the screams, the native ponies had not quite grasped it. Rosin hadn't either, at first.\n\n”Hey, someone broke into my office and stole my fine vodka.” Jenom whined as he barged into the room. Rosin noted the lack of a “Herr Kommandant” before or after than sentence.\n\n”How terrible.” He replied, still staring at the cloudy sky, increasingly black with soot. “Without your booze, you might accidentally do your job.” Jenom realized the faux pas he had made and backed out sheepishly."

What we need is some way to mechanically extract more love from each pony so that they turn into progressive generators rather than something we harvest once.” Urbiates explained. “And yes, smart-ass, I did read that off of a card. Can you help us build these machines or not?”\n\nRosin tapped his chin with a pen. “I believe we can. We don’t have the same food needs, so we’ve had no need to, but I seem to recall that we have some designs laying around. How many do you need?”\n\n”As many as you can supply.”\n\n”And what do we get in return?”\n\n"I don't know how many of our factory farms we can afford if we have to keep building massive ones to get some utility."

Ponies just need to learn that if they don't like your driving, they should stay off the sidewalk." Octy chimed in. "Rosin's a weirdo, though. He can keep the building for all I care."\n\n"Oh, no reason to go that far." Urbiates told him. "We found plenty of good stuff there already. Besides, I bet you can see whatever-it-gets-called well from the upper floors. Although, if the ponies let that eyesore get built, then we have a lot of work to do to fix their outlook."\n\nAnastasia laughed. "They're lucky they have us, then.

severyana_b.4.d:0 ""Name Pending" was going to be a grand hive. It was roughly cylindrical and took up nearly an entire district, allowing them to use the pre-existing structures. It was near the city center, and by extension, allowed them to always see the Palace and make sure nothing incorrect was happening. It was also the first hive founded along Prandialist ideals. Beyond that, the details were still being worked out.\n\nThe sole problem was that, at the moment, it was approximately five changelings in construction helmets and a cool drawing on a chalkboard, although that was getting filled up with names and soon the suggestions would be encroaching on the design.\n\nUrbiates stood on the roof of a city tram, the cabin itself stuffed with nearly a dozen corpses of hacked-apart ponies. A crowd of thousands of changelings surrounded the vehicle. The first vote of the day had been to hold off on eating until a name was chosen, and it had passed. Everyone was regretting that now, four hours later. "Alright, clearly you all don't like any name, and I want to eat!" He shouted. "So how about you take the list of suggestions we have now, and decide your favorite, and shout it out when I do if you support it!" He checked the list of names on the board sitting besides him. "Subterrananononphotopolis!" A few cheers went out. "Terrafluvimonsflorabellatopia!" One girl shouted from the back. "Cerebrasophocognimelantragiopia?" Around a dozen cries rang in the street. Was there really so little consensus? A word struck Urbiates, and he decided to try out, "Ichorograd!" A chorus of noise arose after a second, someone fired into the air in cheer, and the revolutionary breathed a sigh of relief. He had been worried that this issue would never be solved. The construction workers laughed and started moving through the crowd to realize the hive.\n\nAnd everyone got to finally eat lunch."

So did his friends, but not the first one's friends. Now Urbiates had taken it upon himself to get onto the stage erected in the square where two weeks prior he had stood on a tram, and to explain why he felt the first construction worker's plan was better. Once again, many thousands had gathered, although now pits had been dug into the road so that they could eat as they voted.\n\n"Alright, everyone," he announced loudly to the assembly, drawing everyone's eyes. "Topic of the day! As you can see, we've been doing just fine for food, but Ichorograd's pre-existing population is not unlimited." Octy joined him on the stage. "Hey there, Octy. I'm just about to argue that we should create space in the hive-structure for the industrial raising and processing of ponies for long-term sustainability and security."\n\n"What a coincidence!" Octy said back, loudly enough for the crowd to hear. "I was just about to argue that we use ponies like game instead of cattle and raid their preserves for food because we can start now rather than waiting for extensive construction and development!"\n\nUrbiates chuckled to himself. "Guess we don't need to wait for a debate partner, comrade budski. Say, have you considered the high scalability of factory farming ponies as opposed to hunting them in open fields?"\n\n"Indeed I have, and I think that it's outweighed by the health benefits of free-range steak and of having our fighters always being useful." Octy replied deftly.\n\nThe argument continued, point and counterpoint, until members of the audience started chiming in. The day's vote was exclusively for the issue, but the hive's lunchtime was nearing its end and everyone had to go back to work. The final vote was called for, and the result was clear."

Every day since the Prandialists had taken over was a day he failed to wake up from his nightmare, and now… By the Queen, now they were simply killing anyone who they didn't like and leaving them on the streets. Every time he saw the depths of depravity they would sink to, it was like he saw it for the first time. He had just stood back up to start packing for a trip to anywhere, even death by the border patrol units, when he noticed that his appropriated safehouse was not not safe.\n\nUrbiates, the arch-barbarian himself, was sitting in one of the chairs. "Hello, comrade budski. I missed you by a few years. I was just reading a book by one of your associates." He was referring to the one in front of him, which was upside-down. "Huh? Oh." He said, and flipped it over to reveal the title: THE CHANGELINGS MUST PERISH.\n\n"How'd you find me?" Gold Muffin asked to buy time as he weighed his odds of being able to open the door and escape before being brained by something.\n\n"We don't hunt in this neighborhood yet, and funnily enough, this apartment's been having issues with the smell of rotting bodies regardless." He grinned maliciously. "It's infiltration 101. It fits that you'd be done in by not learning from your species' culture."\n\nGold picked up a pan from the counter and charged Urbiates, smacking him square in the face with a loud 'CLANG' as he jumped out of the chair to try and escape. He fell to the ground, and Gold pounced on top of him. He put up his arms to try and block the strikes as Gold brought the pan down again and again, trying to break through before Urbiates maneuvered out and pulled out a gun or just used his better strength and size.\n\nSomething Gold new, but had not yet internalized, was that Urbaites was not the only enemy in the room."

Octy kept stifling a laugh as he pulled out his fancy Lakish Type 14 pistol, leveled it at Gold's head from behind, and pulled the trigger. There was a hollow click, and he pulled the slide back, ejecting a round with a dent in the back from the firing pin. He pulled the trigger and got another empty click and this time the round got stuck in the ejection port when he tried to rack the slide again. He flipped the gun over and smashed Gold Muffin as hard as possible over the head with it. The socialist turned around just in time to get another hit, which caused a round to go off into a wall.\n\nUrbiates crawled out from under Gold, folded out his shovel, and swung it into his face with all his force, throwing him against the wall and knocking him unconscious. The pair kept smashing the hated revolutionary until the puddle of blood reached their hooves, then one more forceful bash with the head of the shovel turned his head flat with a meaty crunch, splattering the area with green blood. The rest of the body shuddered with post-mortal muscle reactions.\n\nPanting and one of them in some pain, they took a second. "Why do you still use that thing? It's a piece of f*cking garbage."\n\n"Hey, don't talk about my gun that way just because it's never fired twice without a malfunction!" Octy demanded.

Well, with the ban on anything entering or leaving the country without special permission, we have to be careful to not get caught. So no putting too much stuff through there. Honestly, what we get is already pretty minor because we get so little of it."\n\n"That seems like an oversight. We should invade the old country so that we can move materials freely." Octy said idly.\n\n"One day we will, comrade budski." Urbiates lazily replied. "Although I do wonder. We're mostly bringing in replacement parts for machinery, and technical documentation. We could probably get more use out of it if we went all-in on one of those. Think we should bring that up to the forum when we get back?"\n\n"Probably," Octy answered. "Which one do you think is better, though?"\n\n"I don't know." Urbiates admitted. He turned to the pony tied up in the backseat. "You have any ideas?"

By now they were standing right in front of the door, near where the fence separating the Prandialist and Vhy sides of the city entered the building. "Alright, then. Have you considered the importance of using democratic syndicalism to revolutionize the productive forces and de-react to the fascist bourgeoisie so that the division of labor can socialize the proletariat?" The mare stared at him, her mouth agape. "I see you haven't." Urbiates continued, pleased with himself.\n\n"What's there to consider? That was just a load of words that leftists use!"

Now he had to sit here, disguised, sharing a train ride with ponies trying to leave St. Petershoof and flee to the rural farms. A pony who was Octy tugged at his shoulder. "Hey, Urbiates." He whispered. "Check out small-and-short over there." Sure enough, a tiny pony across the car had brought out a guitar and was playing for a growing crowd. It was typical pony caterwaul, the lyrics describing a sniper from the war who had supposedly killed hundreds of changelings. It was bold to play such a song in a changeling country, doubly so since the singer was a one-pint wonder.\n\nAs the musician finished and started to extoll the Red Army's virtues further, Urbiates couldn't help but laugh. "What the hell's so funny, huh?" The scale model asked in a thick Equestrian accent when he heard it.\n\n"Sorry, buddy, never seen a statuette that sang before.

Did a PT boat lose its navy-issue meterstick?"\n\n"Well, if it's really that important, I was a CS aboard the CH ship Peace and Love." Their little pony retorted angrily.\n\nIt was Octy's turn to laugh. "CS on a CH? You weren't in the navy, you were a dishwasher in the Merchant Marine!"\n\nThe singer's face twisted. "Wh- Shut the hell up! Shut up! What the hell did you do, huh?"\n\nIn between bursts of chuckling, Urbiates managed to get out, "More than you, six-string-ukelele!"\n\nThe car was unentertained, but Urbiates and Octy were laughing as the train pulled into station."

Anyways, stop pretending you're from here, you're so Equestrian that I smell apple cider just by looking at you."\n\nHe turned back to leave, but the singer kept going. "Like it or not, I'm in the same boat as you all. I came here by choice, and now I can't leave. We're all workers, remember?"\n\nUrbiates thought for a second, and turned to Octy.

Urbiates was large by changeling standards, about the size of an average pony. And the musician was smaller than most changelings.

Wiping the sweat off and panting, he continued. “Okay, so we found some communities of ponies living in the Western mountains in self-made refugee camps. We’re planning on treating them as free food, but we wanted to check with you guys.” The Vhy had a lot more respect for the border, and a bunch of pony communities near the border was something they would take very seriously.\n\nRosin replied disinterestedly, “We will think about it. First, I have some business I would like to attend to with your own faction.” He moved some papers across the table. ”There are a couple personalities we think we can convince to say nice things about our administration, first and foremost this celebrity, Woodie Chipper.”\n\n”No, this is more important.” Urbiates explained. “Those morons are getting self-sufficient and that means we’ll have to deal with them soon.”\n\n”It can be dealt with tomorrow, which my issue may not be because your goons killed him.” Rosin countered accurately.\n\nSensing an argument that was going to go nowhere, Octy pulled out the guitar he’d taken off of the musician and started playing it and singing. Urbiates had heard him before, but he hadn’t realized how nice that guy’s guitar was. Maybe he sold some of his legs to pay for it? Rosin seemed utterly enchanted by it.\n\n”Yeah, he’s pretty good. We took the guitar off of the owner today. I’d say he’s going home in a soup can, but I think he could do that before we killed him.” Urbiates explained.\n\n”That’s Woodie Chipper’s guitar.” Rosin said quietly.

The structure before him was yet another under-construction hive, with a few rough-hewn guards standing around. They waved to him cheerily, but he couldn't help feel unsettled. What would it even mean that a monarch was elected? As he passed the car, he considered taking the piece of wreckage from the grill and using it as a weapon, but he wasn't sure who his enemy was.\n\nHives had rarely been constructed, but in Severyana he was getting used to the sight of dirt and stone walls connecting buildings into one superstructure. On any other day, his guide excitedly telling him about every nook and cranny would have been fun, but he was still reeling. At the center was the old governor's building, which was formerly a palace and distinctly hadn't had its luxury stripped in the years since. That was where he found himself.\n\nThe pedestals where degenerate Equine artworks had been remained, as with the bright carpets and gold trims, as he took the stairs up to the main office. When his guide opened the door without pomp or circumstance, he wondered whether the reports of a monarch were true, but sure enough, behind the governor's desk was a throne, and it was occupied."

You also have a high status because of your own popularity, but you don't see an issue with that."\n\nUrbiates retorted. "I do, actually. I don't like how many changelings let me think for them. But I guess I can't stop them, either. But that's not all. You're taking the power from the common changeling to vest it in yourself, and the common changeling is the ultimate good, not you."\n\nLooking back at him, she replied, "'To be a monarch is to be above another'.

I don't like how it turned out." He said, worriedly.\n\nOcty leaned back, taking his magic off of the typewriter. "Why? I think you argued your case well, although I was hungover at the time, and everyone else agreed. All parties involved respected the decision, although I don't think those guys were in a position to contest us. It seems like it turned out about as well as can be hoped for."\n\nUrbiates stared out the window at a streetlight. "It's exactly that. Was it my case, or was it that I was the one making it? I'm Handicapped Grandpa's most popular contributor. I could ask folks for their cars and they'd give them to me until they figured out I can't drive worth a damn." On the streets below, drones went about their day in the first society designed just for them, to turn their collective needs and desires and ideas into the ruler, or so he had thought.

He wouldn't be dreaming it otherwise.\n\n"It was very difficult to find you." A voice said from behind him, from an entity he hadn't added into his dreamscape.\n\nUrbiates kept looking, thinking about the concrete buildings around the hive spire and the textured surface they made. "If you want an autograph, you need to talk to Octy, he's the one who knows how to sign my name."\n\n"You are one tadpole in an ocean. I don't want your autograph. I want to discuss business." The voice replied, and Urbiates noticed how strange its timbre was. "I admire your craft and am willing to give you incredible power to use as you see fit - if you would only change your priorities a little."\n\nUrbiates rubbed his eyes, thinking that maybe it was worth hearing out. He turned and gasped at what he saw. It looked like a Griffon that had been left dead for a week, decrepit grey rags of skin and fur and feathers barely clinging to its often-exposed skeleton. Its face was half skull and half patches of decomposed flesh. "YOU LOOK DIFFERENT FROM ME!" Urbiates screamed, reaching for a chair. "I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!"\n\n"You buffoon!" The apparition yelled back as the seat smashed against its head, knocking it to the floor. "Stop fighting me, I'm already barely holding on!"\n\n"KILL KILL KILL KILL AAAAAAH!" Urbiates shrieked as he conjured a gun from his imagination and emptied the magazine into the stranger. With every shot, it became wispier and more ethereal until it was gone entirely. Panting, Urbiates fell to his haunches. Even in his dreams, he couldn't escape foreigners. Truly changelings were the most oppressed race."

They're making a documentary on the new continental order and they wanted to see how we're running the place, so I'm showing them around." The honorable Mrs. Zhuk replied, her newest set of stolen nightwear already dirty. "And I can't stand journalists, but I have a soft spot for movie folks. Mind letting them see how such an influential figure spends his days? At least, the ones where you do things besides throw small coins from big buildings."\n\n"You're right, we shouldn't show them national security stuff like that." Urbiates rubbed his chin in contemplation. "Alright, I think we can give them a show." He transitioned to Severyanan as he shook their claws with his hoof. "Name's Urbiates. I'm a huge bigot."\n\n"Guillermo Mondolini," The director replied, thick with Wingbardian accent and novice grasp of the language. "So far, I'm a fan of your work. It will make for some great entertainment, if that's the right word."\n\n"It is. Anyways, let me introduce you to my associate." He turned a corner to reveal Octy, who had just pounced on a local he'd chased from the apartment block. Holding a knife to his throat, he looked at Urbiates. "This is Octy. Octy, this is a documentary crew."\n\n"Am I going to be a movie star?" Octy asked as he began to cut, eliciting a thick gurgling noise.\n\n"Something like that," the director said as every member of the crew leaned in to get a better shot. "You all have been so helpful, but the last thing I must ask of you is if we could spend some time with the Vhy?"\n\n"They're an objectively evil fascist paramilitary organization. The only thing they'll show you is books and self-aggrandizement." Octy stated as he pulled the stallion's head free from his body.

Guillermo exclaimed, his Severyanan noticeably better from when he had arrived.\n\n"Just doing what we can for quality art." Urbiates replied modestly.\n\n"And a name in the credits!"

There was the Ichorograd hive, the history lessons, the Lyctidan shuffle, the Lyctidan hoofshake, the Lyctidan two-step, the Lyctidan social call, the Lyctidan mattress sale... All of those were euphemisms for one violent act or another, and he'd caught them all on film. He was going to win an award for this one, all right.

He had "come to town to visit a friend", a cover story that was going to fool no one and Urbiates knew it. That was the point, though.\n\n"It's not the same. I feel like a damn herder out here, it's so quiet." The "owner" of the house replied. She had come out here with nearly a dozen friends, like many others, to expel everyone from a house in this sleepy town for themselves. The purpose was to create a first line of defense away from the growing settlements. She and her crew would watch this village, use the tunnels they'd dug around to hide their movements, pretend to be random villagers or just the ones they'd supplanted who were still wandering around. If bad guys came, they could use those same tunnels to flee and warn the bigger groups. They weren't likely to, though, since everybody here knew the changelings were watching, just not when or how. They also knew that the changelings were watching for a sign as much as for an excuse.\n\nUrbiates stepped back from the window. "You can't win them all," he accepted, his voice modulated by his disguise. "See anything interesting?"\n\n"No, but we did get one of the former tenants beaten to death. He broke into someone's house to steal food and they thought he was one of us." The homeowner explained. "That was pretty funny. Also, there's a killer on the loose. He thought folks would blame it on us. He's been right so far, mostly. The few who've figured out the truth, well, we'll watch how they use it."\n\nUrbiates rubbed his chin. "Playing the long game, huh? Good call. I do think I've seen enough, though. Thanks for letting me over." He moved towards the stairs to the basement, as his exit was in the new sub-basement, part of how 12 changelings could live in a house built for maybe 7 ponies. This initiative was looking like a success."

He could see the industrial district, the tall apartment buildings, the office he never used on the 5th floor of the Palace and Rosin's office on the 13th. He could just about see the wind as it blew through his clothes and across his face.\n\nThe hive was going to be shorter and wider than most. The roof would be mostly flat until it curved up to a short spire in the middle, while the walls would be at a steep angle, but it was still multiple stories tall at its shortest. Far below, he could also see the construction equipment tearing up dirt to make the rammed earth walls that would be multiple stories tall. He could see the pits, the demolished buildings, the skyways for the buildings that had simply been absorbed, and the utility work going on to make the structure support a population the size of the rest of the city's in less than one-tenth the space.\n\nIt would be unthinkable for the small mind of a pony, but normal for a changeling.\n\nAs Urbiates looked out across the massive construction taking place, he felt a little bit of pride. This was not his victory, but one of the whole changeling race, and yet he had done his part to help. He'd dictated so many articles for political magazines, and also killed a LOT of people, so this was partially, moderately, ever-so-slightly his doing as well.\n\n"Well, comrade budski, I think we have it made now." He said to himself. Behind him, Octy slipped from the beam he was balancing on and hit his head on another as he fell down. Luckily, he regained his balance and the sound of plastic-like wings flapping back up soon came.\n\nYup. All they had to do was not screw up."

After weeks of trekking across the Severyanan mud and ice, watching the Panzergrenadiers drive by unimpeded in their half-tracks, Urbiates had gotten the opportunity to try some out, and it was awful! The engines needed a hammer and two priests to start, and then they would break after four hours, and the armored car had caught fire from trying to climb a hill, and he nearly had a chitin crack from trying to go off-road, and it was bad, and who would ever drive one of these f*cking things?! Just hop on a direwolf if you're tired of walking, you stupid ponies!\n\nThat aside, the factory itself was nice, even before a few thousand settlers started changeling-ifying it. Plenty of interior and underground space, built like a fortress, a pleasant scent of wet metal... And more settlers were coming to make sure production restarted in earnest, and the locals didn't complain.\n\n"The place certainly cleans up well, Ann." Urbiates commented to Anastasia.\n\n"Even I'm shocked by it. There was an issue with some squatters attacking us when we tried to come down here, but we defended ourselves." She replied, sighing with satisfaction. This particular settlement was her idea, although many other large population centers were gaining similar encampments. "I do want to run something by you, though. There's a lot of big open areas that would be good for animal pens. That would kind of keep us from using the factory as intended, but we could do some really good work if we had a lot more direwolves, archvultures, whatever. It would be a lot easier to keep the ponies from putting us in self-defense situations."\n\nUrbiates was taken aback. "Wow, that's a pretty good idea. Huh.""

The former turned to the back of the car, and saw Rosin retreating into his coat the way a turtle retreats into his shell. It had been his idea to be seen hanging out with him for a day to make it look like both groups didn’t totally hate each other, to make it stranger.\n\nIt was a shame that, to make it through this national adventure, they did have to work with those pricks. For now.\n\nThe car arrived at the grand front entrance of Ichorograd after Octy found a way to hide that he was looking at a map and they stopped being lost. “Here we are,” Urbiates said to Rosin. “Welcome to Ichorograd, comrade budski.”\n\nHe was nearly silent throughout the tour. He made some polite small talk, but never adjusted to the charnel pits, the abattoirs, the public forums, the ossuaries, and the other infrastructure and amenities of Ichorograd. Then again, authentic changeling culture wasn’t his thing, not really.\n\nThe changelings of Ichorograd had been saving skulls of partisans, officers, governors, anyone of note they could get, and they had built a grand totem in the center of the hive, in its greatest hall, and it was the tour’s finale. In days past, many changeling households had owned the skulls of defeated foreigners, but now it was all held in common. Rosin seemed startled by the sight, and pointed to the top, where the spire ended in a chair of bones. “Who is it for?” He asked.\n\n”Princess Celestia,” Urbiates replied proudly.\n\nRosin seemed confused by the answer. “Why did you build this?”\n\n”Come on, Rosin. Don’t tell me you don’t feel their power coursing through this hive. We have their skulls, we have their souls, great and pathetic alike, all chained to the will of our hive.” Urbiates explained. “It’s a fine spin on an ancient tradition, one which your precious Chrysalis tried to stamp out.”\n\nRosin cocked his head. “Ah.”"

He was a statistician, but wore a lab coat as if he ever worked with material of any sort. While he had once spoken with the same candor as everyone around him, he had since taken on a distinct tone of voice, one which loved big words and hated uncertain language. These were all habits he had picked up recently. What wasn’t a new habit was his social awkwardness, which had always been in the background when he talked.\n\nHe was the smartest changeling Urbiates knew when it came to logic, and looking like a scientist from a badly-written movie was how that was conveyed to the changelings who did NOT know him. Also Urbiates had long forgotten his real name.\n\n”So we ran the numbers, and if we want this country to be sustainable over the long-term, we need to expand our food supplies sooner rather than later. There’s nearly a million of us, more if you count those blackshirts. We were theoretically on-track, but love efficiency is below expectations.” The Boffin explained. “Turns out that factory farm environments aren’t conducive to love generation.”\n\nUrbiates cursed under his breath. “We should have expected them to screw us like this, by being miserable and stuff. What can we do about it?”\n\nThe Boffin theatrically adjusted his glasses. “Well, the best way is to make the farms kinder, but that’s politically untenable.”\n\n”As it should be.” Urbiates added.\n\n”Thus, we need to increase input, or mechanically increase efficiency.” He looked nervous. “The former is quite expensive. The latter is… difficult. We can’t do it. The Vhy can. Even though we outnumber them nearly 6 to 1, they have more PhD’s than we do, and more engineering technology on their side of the country.”\n\nUrbiates gritted his teeth. “So pay out the nose from our pockets or our pride.

Now, in Severyana, massive swathes of land were being turned into game county. Changelings all over were finding their own hunting culture. Some went out with a gun and came back with the next few months of food. Others had their own methods.\n\nThe changeling standing in front of Urbiates was not wearing tweed, although he thought he was. Real bespoke hunters also did not use submachine guns. But this changeling was “Hunter Gravestone”, the pseudonymous leading author in the new hunting community, and he had a concern.\n\n”You see,” Hunter began in a strange cadence, “we are not managing these grounds as aggressively as we should. Overhunting means lost efficiency as populations regrow, and underhunting means the ponies gain too much cohesion and start organizing, and both are common. On top of that, our method of categorizing the fields is insufficient. These plains are good sport, but what of the woods? Tromp around there and you’re liable to be shot by confused fellows or lucky partisan-skis.”\n\n”What of democracy?” Urbiates asked. “This much regulation is likely to step on a lot of necks.”\n\n”Pish-posh, they can democratically decide which ground is suitable for them!” Hunter yelled, and it became clear he was speaking in a bad Equestrian noble accent. “We ought to mark every field we can as protected and for sporting purposes, and let the exterminators have any pony who tries to hide in the forests or hills.”\n\n”And if that isn’t acceptable?” Urbiates prodded.\n\nHunter harrumphed. ”Well, at the very least, we ought to create headcounts and such.

The largest figure was Urbiates, who had put his submachine gun away, and now held two burning torches aloft in his magic. He had to be careful, dropping one or even just waving them around in the wrong place could set off every firework in the building and take out everything within a hundred meters with no warning. “Are those really necessary?” One of his comrade budskis asked through a forceful whisper.\n\n“Yes, now shut up.” Octy replied.\n\nThe shelves were high, but with traditional Severyanan fastidiousness around explosives, rockets and cherry bombs were arranged in loose piles, each at least 90% of the same type and at least three centimeters from any fire hazard. Urbiates held up a torch to an unreadably dirty sign, and saw that it said “NO SMOKING”. Satisfied that he wasn’t breaking the safety rules, he turned around and saw a pony in a dull grey greatcoat and equally grey hat. It was uncanny, most ponies would rather wear nothing at all than dress so drably, but for many years grey clothing had been the only kind legal in the changeling lands for non-military personnel, a de-facto ban on uniforms for any non-government organization to keep rebels from organizing. And because of the climate, greatcoats were popular.\n\nUrbiates didn’t understand why a pony was dressed like a changeling, and he hated things he didn’t understand. He threw one of the torches directly at it. The pony watched as it bounced off the tough coat leaving nothing but a black stain, and then calmly stamped it out as it rolled on the ground. “Tracking you down was tough enough, you don’t need to make it harder.” Urbiates’s comrades ran up behind him and they realized that there wasn’t one pony, but nearly a dozen."

severyana_b.37.d:0 "“My name is One March. You are, presumably, Urbiates orn Marks.” The pony said from the other side of the junky table. “Please, take a seat.”\n\n”Yes, that’s me.” Urbiates cautiously admitted as he pulled up a chair. “You might be the first pony to want to talk to me.”\n\n”I’d like to start by apologizing for that. I’m sure you’ve known creatures who complain about their saddlebags but refuse to take out the rocks.” The pony continued with an untraceable accent. “And in this country, the last thirty years have been the government proclaiming that holding rocks is its own reward. We believe that there’s a better way, and that you can show us where to look.” He smiled, and Urbiates felt a flash of something familiar, but completely out of place.\n\n”I appreciate the confidence, but I don’t think the Prandialist way has a lot that a pony would find valuable.” He replied, off-guard for the first time in years. What was happening?\n\nMarch waved it away. ”Not you specifically. We mean the changelings in general. Your kind and the Vhy have more in common with each other than you do with the likes of us. We’d like to discuss working with you for our mutual benefit.”\n\nUrbiates tentatively looked at his equally-confused compatriots and leaned over the table. “And why should we work with dinner?”\n\n”Because you have an image problem.” March put his hoof down. “You look like monsters, and nobody can be bothered to change it. I’m still referring to all of your kind here, by the way. That might seem fine, but fighting is expensive, and if it never ends, you’re just going to keep paying for replacements, often with more fighting. You need a way to get things by asking. You need friends.”\n\n”And you’re the friends?” Urbiates asked lazily.\n\n”Better.” March smirked. “We’re the ones who will get you the friends.”\n\nUrbiates looked to his cohort again. They were looking back as if to say that the budskis in black would need to be brought in if this would go further... if it did."

#we let them get the nuclear codes

severyana_d.1.t:0 "NOTICE"
severyana_d.1.d:0 "It has come to the attention of the Queen of All Equus that the state of the Severyana Protectorate developed and produced a nuclear weapon. This industry is as admirable as the power behind this weapon, and it shall serve the Fatherland well. A transport aircraft capable of carrying it shall arrive at Poedei Airport, formerly Petershoof Airport, in order to bring it into our care. Full details to follow."
severyana_d.1.a:0 "We are proud to serve!"
severyana_d.1.b:0 "Again?"

severyana_d.2.t:0 "Crisis Averted"
severyana_d.2.d:0 "In the Severyana Exclusion Zone, the government somehow managed to acquire nuclear weapons. Luckily for us, before they could use them, our liason discovered it and ordered it be taken into our custody on our Queen's behalf. Whatever depraved use they had planned for such a weapon is now thwarted, and we will be keeping close watch on them to make sure they do not get to keep any future nuclear arms. Sadly, we do not have any good way to acquire or even disable their nuclear production facilities, and we're not even sure how they managed to get them active.\n\nFor now, at least, peace will not be threatened by those miscreated abominations, and we have an extra nuclear bomb for our trouble."
severyana_d.2.e:0 "The Severyana Exclusion Zone had produced more nuclear weapons for us. We have taken them into our custody, and our nuclear arsenal has grown while that of the deranged rogue state has been shrunk. Until we find a better way to handle this situation long-term, we shall continue to maintain the status quo in this manner."

#Decisions
SEV_army:0 "Split Divisions"
SEV_army_desc:0 "The backbone of the Severyan military is the Vhy divisions who were sent here along with their heavy weapons, augmented by whatever Prandialists we can wrangle. With how expensive it is operating this country, we can't afford to upset the veteran and well-worn structures, nor can we make our own, but we can attempt to duplicate their organization, as long as we have enough spare material.\n\nYou have split divisions §Y[?sev_splitcounter]§! times, and split Special divisions §Y[?sev_sfsplitcounter]§! times. Every ten splits lets you split another Special division."
SEV_3rd_div:0 "3rd "Lyctida" Division"
SEV_3rd_div_desc:0 "Infantry with heavy self-propelled artillery support.\n\nEmblem: Golden Spiral\n\nPressed into frontline service from its defensive role, the newly-expanded security force was given heavy artillery and a new commanding officer: Doctor Rosin Lyctia, a personal friend of Captain Dieter Heinrich and respected researcher. It's combat record under his command was generally average, and their highest claim to fame was participating in the siege of Canterlot, after which they were permanently transferred to the Stalliongrad front. Many suspect they set the blaze that won that battle, but the Queen has declared that untrue."
SEV_4th_div:0 "4th "Rot" Division"
SEV_4th_div_desc:0 "Infantry with some anti-tank, artillery, and anti-air, plus medium tank destroyers.\n\nEmblem: Exponential Growth Curve\n\nThe Vhy 4th Division was originally Lyctidan, but after it was destroyed in its first battle, the name was turned over to the largest pony collaborator force. The ponies of the "Rot", or the N.O.E., were an eclectic group of outcasts and ex-convicts who took whatever they could salvage and had little respect for the Queen's rules of war. Somehow, their strange mix of stolen equipment kept them alive no matter how many times they were used as cannon fodder."
SEV_7th_div:0 "7th "Blodtruppen" Division"
SEV_7th_div_desc:0 "Mechanized infantry with a bias towards anti-tank ability.\n\nEmblem: Axe in a Pony Skull\n\nOne of the few Vhy divisions recruited from a specific hive that wasn't Lyctidia, the Vraksians of the 7th "Blodtruppen" weren't known for their extremism or bloodlust. In spite of this, the division was responsible for a substantial number of massacres, exterminations, and general failure to follow orders, which their officers always claimed to be freak accidents caused by individual soldiers making logical errors in the field."
SEV_9th_div:0 "9th "Mercury" Division"
SEV_9th_div_desc:0 "Motorized with artillery.\n\nEmblem: Tangent Lines\n\nStarting out as a brigade, the 9th "Mercury" was boosted by its commander being related to the manager of a car factory. When Vhy brigades began to be expanded to full-sized divisions to fill the holes, the one which was already entirely motorized (kind of) was one of the first. During the war, it recieved some of the most notorious orders of the war and carried each one out dutifully. This unlucky streak left the division with a terrible reputation that still persists."
SEV_11th_div:0 "11th "Monarchin" Division"
SEV_11th_div_desc:0 "Motorized with some extra armor for support.\n\nEmblem: Long S\n\nOne of the Vhy's signaturely large military police units that was rebranded to a field division, the changelings of this unit were forever marked by their early days as soldiers, when they made up for their lack of training with a brutality that had been acceptable against anti-government activists yet was thorougly banned against the armies of the nations the changeling state wanted to rule peacefully. In time, they learned how to fight properly, but by then they had infamy... and a tradition."
SEV_14th_div:0 "14th "Ein Verdammte Schneeflocke" Division"
SEV_14th_div_desc:0 "Stormtroopers with some support companies.\n\nEmblem: Hexagon\n\nDrawn from the entire nation, this division, made up primarily of the herding class, was supposed to be forest specialists first rather than urban or fort specialists who were given extra training to be somewhat adept in woodland. Results were disappointing, with no real benefit compared to the normal Jager and Storm Team programs, and the division was constantly implicated for disobeying orders to not eat prisoners, but it was competent enough that it survived the war as an organization."
SEV_18th_div:0 "18th "Fanatiker" Division"
SEV_18th_div_desc:0 "Medium armor with mechanized and support SPAA.\n\nEmblem: Astrological H\n\nOf the Vhy's divisions, the 18th is quite possibly the most ideologically motivated. Slavishly loyal to Queen Chrysalis, this division, many of whom were drawn from the Chrysalis Youth, are consequently the most chivalrous to their enemies. However, they also have gotten into shooting conflicts with their own allies for "insufficient zeal", and famously once saw the soldiers execute a Lieutenant for cowardice for ordering a retreat in spite of the high command."
SEV_25th_div:0 "25th "Wotan" Brigade"
SEV_25th_div_desc:0 "Infantry with artillery.\n\nEmblem: Eight-Legged Changeling\n\nDespite starting out as a brigade within the 15th "Stahlschwarm", the 25th Brigade was split off as its own entity to defend occupied coastland. While there, it soon found itself fending off an Equestrian offensive, which it managed by conscripting the local pegasi to create the ideal winds for an attack by fire that proved decisive. The commander was awarded handsomely for defending the town against six times as many soldiers on short notice, but the brutal methods secretly gained him another kind of attention."
SEV_28th_div:0 "28th "Princip" Brigade"
SEV_28th_div_desc:0 "Infantry with engineers.\n\nEmblem: Olenian Flag\n\nNo single unit within the Changeling Armed Forces has managed to be so grotesque yet so long-lived as the "Princip" Brigade. Formed in Olenia when a desperate governor conscripted the local prison population to aid in the defence of his region, they quickly defected to the Heer, who constantly shuffled them around to keep anyone from noticing that they were absolutely useless at everything and were mostly an alternate death sentance for Olenians. They have now been passed on to the Vhy specifically so that they could be sent to Severyana."
SEV_31st_div:0 "31st Vhy "Vril" Division"
SEV_31st_div_desc:0 "Massed MBT's with mechanized.\n\nEmblem: Two V's Stacked Vertically\n\nIn the Fatherland, the Vhy continued to build bigger and better tanks. The better tanks went to the 31st, a battalion designed for testing large unit tactics with the new generation of armor, which was singularly versatile. Before and during the Veteran's Revolt, it was expanded repeatedly until it was a full-sized division. As a unit featured in much propaganda, it became unusually vain, especially regarding its tanks. When they started using the vehicles for executions via cannon and tread, it was removed from the front until being sent to Severyana."
SEV_40th_div:0 "40th Vhy "Stay Away" Division"
SEV_40th_div_desc:0 "Mountaineers with infantry.\n\nEmblem: Exclamation Point\n\nThroughout the years, many groups have tried to turn the Dennites of the far north into a fighting force. In theory, having no fear of death nor hesitance to kill others would make for an ideal soldier. The Vhy's attempt might have been the most succesful ever: In six months of campaigning, only 10% of the unit was killed by friendly fire. It has since been expanded from a brigade to a division, but the low population density of the Dennites has meant that we have filled the ranks with non-Dennites who work alongside them. Why it wasn't disposed of or taken back north and disbanded is a strange question, but now it is here."
SEV_42nd_div:0 "42nd Vhy "Fallschirmpanzer" Brigade"
SEV_42nd_div_desc:0 "Paratroopers with armor support.\n\nEmblem: Shooting Star\n\nProject Meteor should never have been funded, but it was, and inexplicably, it produced results. Not the ones hoped for, but being able to drop a heavy tank from a plane is a feat regardless of its armament. It's just a shame that the unit which makes use of this tech is one which treats every battle as if it's its last. Rarely an operation went by where some element of the 42nd didn't go rogue and do something illegal in order to try and get an extra advantage. Still, they shouldn't be underestimated."
SEV_dr_div:0 "Saturn Task Unit 'Todesstrahltrager'"
SEV_dr_div_desc:0 "Magic infantry with rockets.\n\nEmblem: N/A\n\nDuring the Veteran's Revolt, the largest magical equipment factory on the continent fell under siege by rebel forces. However, by linking up with allies and using their magical weapons to annihilate any area that the enemies were using, the facility's security staff held out and even went on the offensive. After retaking a shipment of rocket artillery and soldiers that had been captured by rebels, it became a full-fledged brigade, and when it was rescued, it had so much heavy equipment at its disposal that it was declared a divison and expanded."
SEV_heer_9th_div:0 "9th Panzer-Attacker Division 'Nera In Niyro'"
SEV_heer_9th_div_desc:0 "Magical mechanized led by superheavy tanks.\n\nEmblem: Fish on a Spear\n\nThe idea behind the formation of the 9th Panzer-Attacker division was to concentrate as much power in a small place as possible to not only force the enemy to retreat, but to destroy them in the first battle. The error, however, was allowing Trimmel to build all of it himself. The resultant division was as strong as was hoped, but was over-reliant on massed firepower as a solution. Despite its strength, or rather because of it, it was completely uneconomical at best, and at worst a danger to everything around it. It was also the first Heer division to be sent to Severyana."
SEV_militia:0 "Prandialist Militia"
SEV_militia_desc:0 "Infantry with motorized and some AA.\n\nEmblem: N/A\n\nMilitias created from whatever is available is a staple of the Prandialist way of warfare, which generally advises against direct confrontation and instead encourages demographic victories. Still, they can be thrown against real opponents if they have to be, and sometimes they even win. They come in all shapes and sizes, but they most commonly have some personal vehicles integrated into the force, as well as infiltration experts and heavy weapons."
SEV_inf_div:0 "Prandialist Unification"
SEV_inf_div_desc:0 "Infantry.\n\nEmblem: N/A\n\nMass mobilization is the cornerstone of Prandialist philosophy, and no entity depicts this better than "Unifications", their answer to divisions. These ad-hoc formations of barely-trained assemblies, one step above an especially lively riot, are the massive bodies used as the attacking force when an entire district isn't behaving how the Prandialist collective desires. Of course, when you have an army made out of whover showed up, you take what you can get."
