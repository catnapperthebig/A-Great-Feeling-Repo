SEV_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Karabiner 998. kurz"
SEV_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Karabiner 98k"
SEV_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Early Changeling designs for bolt-action rifles were often confused and unreliable. The Karabiner 98, along with the rest of the project to create an infantry loadout to Dieter's design, wound up being the first to work well when properly mass-produced. The rifle would be the mainstay of the Heer until the end of the war."
SEV_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Gewehr mod. 1007"
SEV_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Gewehr 7"
SEV_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "Dieter's plans proved to be a good blueprint, but they weren't designed with any normal race in mind. Modifications to the infantryman's kit to take advantage of new discoveries quickly found themelves in order, and the Changeling military obsession with grenades began to appear."
SEV_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Machinenpistole 1010"
SEV_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "MP 90"
SEV_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The MP-80 project, unexpectedly, was one of the first new-generation Changeling firearms completed, being that Dieter already had a working model to pattern off of. Finding their place in the doctrine, however, took much longer, as Changeling officers didn't trust the diminutive cartridge at first, but it would eventually become the most iconic Changeling weapon of the war."
SEV_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Stormrifle 1013"
SEV_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "SR 13"
SEV_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The StormRifle marked a turning point in weapons developement. It was the first time the desire came before the design, although there was still much inspiration. Sadly, the forward-thinking design came with too many mechanical quirks to be a standard weapon."
SEV_infantry_equipment_x:0 "Stormrifle 1019"
SEV_infantry_equipment_x_short:0 "SR 19"
SEV_infantry_equipment_x_desc:0 "The most mature Changeling infantry loadout came in 1019, during the Second Hearthswarming Crisis, where, at the height of their power, the Second Wehrmacht gave this rifle to certain high-value units. Underbarrel attachments were very common in this pattern, which made it expensive."
SEV_infantry_equipment_x_2:0 "Project-Ultra Rifle 25"
SEV_infantry_equipment_x_2_short:0 "PUR"
SEV_infantry_equipment_x_2_desc:0 "Although it never had widespread adoption, this rifle was well-known for its place in the kill-teams fielded by MONOCOL during the later Succession Years. The other implements of destruction were similarly-regarded, especially because so much power was given to tunnel-clearers"

SEV_gw_tank_equipment:0 "Power Cracker X"
SEV_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Although conventional history says that tanks were first fielded during the Stalliongradian revolt, many creatures (nearly all of them Changelings) would argue that the true first usage was a kind of mobile cannon favored during the later Unification Wars. The Power Cracker was an evolution on that design, most notable for having an engine instead of holes in the floor. It never saw use before the Panzers became dominant."

SEV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2:0 "Sturmtiger"
SEV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_short:0 "Sturmtiger"
SEV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Sturmtiger was a siege mortar built into a Tiger hull. Despite this being an offensive weapon made during a defensive war, it made a name for itself in the Major Offensive. By day, the armor protected them from counterbatteries, and by night, the job was done by the ghostly wails coming from the barrel when the breach was left open and the crew inside snored, which caused attacking ponies to retreat out of fear."
SEV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3:0 "Geschützwagen Tiger"
SEV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "Based on the hull of a King Tiger, it was to be able to mount a 170mm K 72 L/50 gun. However, the sole prototype built was destroyed when it was used as cover when the factory designing it fell under attack."

SEV_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Linebreaker T6 Canoe was an early version of the Linebreaker that held a heavy artillery piece in the bed. Although it was intended to be the main gun, it could still be pitched up, and this was its most useful configuration. The nickname came from the open top of the long, now-flat design."

SEV_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3:0 "Panzerjäger Tiger Ausf. B"
SEV_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Jagdtiger was the heaviest armoured fighting vehicle operationally used by Changeling Heer. The vehicle carried a 128 mm PaK 44 L/55 main gun, and carried heavy frontal armour."
SEV_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_short:0 "Jagdtiger"
SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "Linebreaker"
SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Linebreaker program was a series of prototypes designed to combine Dieter's high-mobility armored assault strategy with a more old-styled focus on special high-energy designs. However, magic and industry function on different rules, and the resulting designs were scrapped for being unable to do anything extremely well and being horribly expensive."
SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Linebreaker"
SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger"
SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Tiger I was a Changeling heavy tank developed in 1012 as an answer to the unexpectedly impressive Stalliongradian armour encountered in the initial months of the Changeling invasion of the Equestria, particularly the T-34 and the KV-1. To this end, it did its job masterfully whenever it wasn't suffering some sort of technical issue, which it usually was."
SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Tiger"
SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_3:0 "Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausf. B Tiger II"
SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Known under the informal name 'Trnir-Tiger' but, often semi-literally translated as the Bigger Tiger by Equestrian soldiers, the Tiger II combined the thick armour of the Tiger I with the sloped armour used on the Panther medium tank. The tank weighed almost seventy metric tons, and was the first to use Thaumatic Sabot rounds, making it able of penetrating nearly anything."

SEV_light_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "Towed guns which were assigned to the infantry gun companies of motorised infantry regiments had difficulties keeping up with tanks during combat. The easiest solution was to modify a spare tank chassis to carry it into battle. In the case of the Bison, it uses the chassis of the Panzer I."

SEV_light_tank_equipment_1:0 "Panzerkampfwagen I"
SEV_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Panzer I was a light tank produced in Changeling Lands in the 1000's, and the first of many tanks to have Dieter's influence. Design of the Panzer I began in 1005 and some production began in 1006. Intended only as a training tank to introduce the concept of armoured warfare to the Changeling Heer, the PzKpfw I found use anyways as a stopgap until more advanced tanks could be produced."
SEV_light_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Panzer I"
SEV_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen II"
SEV_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Panzer II was originally designed as a second stopgap, but was found to be capable enough to function as a frontline tank, and thus entered mass production regardless. A number of issues caused by immature doctrine were pre-empted and solved, and then a whole host of new ones were added because the nation had started mass-producing cars within the last decade and this was much more complicated."

SEV_light_tank_equipment_3:0 "VK 1602 Leopard"
SEV_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The VK1602 Leopard was a planned Changeling reconnaissance vehicle designed in 1012. However, what was turned in was an armored car with a rocket launcher taped to the top as a protest against severe budget cuts. This proved to be more economical, so the design was accepted, causing the director to go mad and light the blueprints on fire. This is not that design."

SEV_medium_tank_aa_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Flakpanzer IV 'Ostwind' was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun based on the Panzer IV tank. It was developed in 1012 as a successor to the earlier Flakpanzer IV. The Panzer IV's turret was removed and replaced with an open-top, hexagonal turret which housed a 3.7 cm FlaK 43. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but this was not possible due to the heavy smoke generated by the gun."

SEV_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Sd.Kfz. 138/1 Grille was a Self-Propelled Artillery Piece that was used by Changelings during Invasion of Equestria. They were popular in Panzer divisions fighting in rough terrain. The name comes from the fact that the radiator was replaced with a smaller, cheaper version, not realizing the weight wasn't much different from the normal chassis. The engine block could be used to cook meat."

SEV_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Sturmgeschütz III assault gun was the Changeling's most produced armoured fighting vehicle during invasion of Equestria. It was built on the chassis of the proven Panzer III tank. Initially intended as a mobile, armoured light gun for infantry support, the StuG was continually modified and was widely employed as a tank destroyer."

SEV_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3:0 "Jagdpanther"
SEV_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Jagdpanther was a tank destroyer built on the chassis of the Panther tank. It entered service late in 1014. The Jagdpanther combined the very powerful 8.8 cm PaK 43 cannon of the Tiger II and the characteristically excellent armour and suspension of the Panther chassis."

SEV_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "Panzerkampfwagen III"
SEV_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "From the start, the plan was for the martial industry to teethe on Panzer I and II's before transferring to the real threats:\nThe Panzer III and IV were to be similar designs, with the III specialized for fighting infantry with a stubby HE-thrower and the IV for fighting armor with a long cannon, with both able to play the role of the other in a pinch. Which they did, especially in the later war."

SEV_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen IV"
SEV_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed with a long 75mm "Kwaker" anti-tank gun as its primary armament, the Panzer IV was the main battle tank of the Heer for much of the war, and never truly left service.\nIt is now remembered for two unique abilities: being up-armored once a year until the engine and transmission were no longer reliable, and being misidentified as a Tiger regularly."

SEV_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "Panzerkampfwagen V Panther"
SEV_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Panther is the common name of a medium tank deployed by Changelings from mid-1014. It was intended as a counter to the Stalliongradian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside the heavier Tiger tank. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks ever created."

SEV_magical_equipment_3_desc:0 "The TEK-19 was the version that started making waves. Minaturization allowed for in-built thaumatic braiding, greatly increasing the stability over range, while 'continuous' mode was replaced with 'flicker', which was much more sustainable. The other effect of thaumatic braiding, light inversion, was also present, which necessitated yet more special eye protection but looked beautiful on camera."

SEV_magical_equipment_4_desc:0 "The TREK-25 was the pinnacle of magical weapons in the Changeling Lands for a very long time. Due to their use of electricity, previous iterations could be nullfiied by Fair Day meshes, which were so easy to work with that they could even be used as personal armor. This model had a magical sorting mechanism to allow it to only aim at 'animated' things, meaning living beings, but also vehicles."

nuke_first.1.d_changeling_fascism:0 "Queen Chrysalis sat in the bunker, staring eagerly across the open field. In the far distance, a speck, a tower carrying a steel oval, sat. Between the two, miles of land and an inch of protective glass.\nNearly a dozen scientists and engineers were watching, but they didn't get to push the custom-made giant red button with a skull painted on it. The head theoretician hung up his phone just as a buzzer went off, and said, "We are go for operations. Start when ready." Before he could finish saying the last sentence, the Queen slammed down on the button with all her might, causing a brilliant teal flash from the tower.\nThe theoretician was torn between concern at the spectacular size of the weapon's effect, and the fact that the Queen was staring at it, jaw hanging open limply in adoration. Such a massive explosion, such a noise - and it left behind a poison that her own changelings were nearly immune to. It was perfect."

severyana_a.0.d:0 "Faithful subjects of Empress and Princess alike understandably took heart to see the Prandialists sent to strike out on their own at the center of international communism, even more so when the less-savory elements of the Vhy were sent along to "keep them in check". With three implacable evils turning on one another, the thinking went that the forces of right couldn't help but win.\n\nUnfortunately, what came next was not so simple as that idealized world.\n\nIf you wish to try to change the fate of the Severyana Exclusion Zone, for better or for worse, you may. Be warned, however, that what awaits shall be misery, barbarism, zealotry, and more gore than four score Great Wars. There is no shame in staying on the kinder side of the border, that you may smother your child in its sleep when the time is right. In the eyes of the world, that is the best thing you will be able to do."
