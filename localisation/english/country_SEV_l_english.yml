sev_dual_administration_desc:0 "The Severyanan Protectorate (or Severyanan Exclusion Zone to those outside it) is a region split between two factions, both of whom have a disdain for each other matched only by their disdain for the local ponies.\n\nOn the right side of the nation, covering the coastline and a stretch of land that reaches to the capital city, are the territories held by parts of the Vhy, a pro-Imperial extremist organization. They are led by Kommandant Rosin Lyctia, a visionary biolinguist and personal friend of Captain Dieter Heinrich himself, who is the tyrant of the army that he must turn into a government.\n\nOn the other side, Prandialists own most of the interior land, and they plunder it as is convenient. They are represented by Urbiates orn Marks, who wields significant influence through his personal popularity while also being someone who the Vhy can communicate with consistently."

SEV_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Karabiner 98k"
SEV_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Early Changeling designs for bolt-action rifles were often confused and unreliable. The Karabiner 98, along with the rest of the project to create an infantry loadout to Dieter's design, wound up being the first to work well when properly mass-produced. The rifle would be the mainstay of the Heer until the end of the war."
SEV_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Gewehr mod. 1007"
SEV_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Gewehr 7"
SEV_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "Dieter's plans proved to be a good blueprint, but they weren't designed with any normal race in mind. Modifications to the infantryman's kit to take advantage of new discoveries quickly found themelves in order, and the Changeling military obsession with grenades began to appear."
SEV_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Machinenpistole 1010"
SEV_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "MP 90"
SEV_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The MP-80 project, unexpectedly, was one of the first new-generation Changeling firearms completed, being that Dieter already had a working model to pattern off of. Finding their place in the doctrine, however, took much longer, as Changeling officers didn't trust the diminutive cartridge at first, but it would eventually become the most iconic Changeling weapon of the war."
SEV_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Stormrifle 1013"
SEV_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "SR 13"
SEV_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The StormRifle marked a turning point in weapons developement. It was the first time the desire came before the design, although there was still much inspiration. Sadly, the forward-thinking design came with too many mechanical quirks to be a standard weapon."
SEV_infantry_equipment_x:0 "Stormrifle 1019"
SEV_infantry_equipment_x_short:0 "SR 19"
SEV_infantry_equipment_x_desc:0 "The most mature Changeling infantry loadout came in 1019, during the Second Hearthswarming Crisis, where, at the height of their power, the Second Wehrmacht gave this rifle to certain high-value units. Underbarrel attachments were very common in this pattern, which made it expensive."

SEV_infantry_equipment_x_2_desc:0 "Although it never had widespread adoption, this rifle was well-known for its place in the kill-teams fielded by MONOCOL during the later Succession Years. The other implements of destruction were similarly-regarded, especially because so much power was given to tunnel-clearers"

SEV_gw_tank_equipment:0 "Power Cracker X"
SEV_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Although conventional history says that tanks were first fielded during the Stalliongradian revolt, many creatures (nearly all of them Changelings) would argue that the true first usage was a kind of mobile cannon favored during the later Unification Wars. The Power Cracker was an evolution on that design, most notable for having an engine instead of holes in the floor. It never saw use before the Panzers became dominant."

SEV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_short:0 "Sturmtiger"
SEV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Sturmtiger was a siege mortar built into a Tiger hull. Despite this being an offensive weapon made during a defensive war, it made a name for itself in the Major Offensive. By day, the armor protected them from counterbatteries, and by night, the job was done by the ghostly wails coming from the barrel when the breach was left open and the crew inside snored, which caused attacking ponies to retreat out of fear."
SEV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3:0 "Geschützwagen Tiger"
SEV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "Based on the hull of a King Tiger, it was to be able to mount a 170mm K 72 L/50 gun. However, the sole prototype built was destroyed when it was used as cover when the factory designing it fell under attack."

SEV_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Linebreaker T6 Canoe was an early version of the Linebreaker that held a heavy artillery piece in the bed. Although it was intended to be the main gun, it could still be pitched up, and this was its most useful configuration. The nickname came from the open top of the long, now-flat design."

SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "Linebreaker"
SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Linebreaker program was a series of prototypes designed to combine Dieter's high-mobility armored assault strategy with a more old-styled focus on special high-energy designs. However, magic and industry function on different rules, and the resulting designs were scrapped for being unable to do anything extremely well and being horribly expensive."
SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Linebreaker"
SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger"
SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Tiger I was a Changeling heavy tank developed in 1012 as an answer to the unexpectedly impressive Stalliongradian armour encountered in the initial months of the Changeling invasion of the Equestria, particularly the T-34 and the KV-1. To this end, it did its job masterfully whenever it wasn't suffering some sort of technical issue, which it usually was."

SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_3:0 "Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausf. B Tiger II"
SEV_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Known under the informal name 'Trnir-Tiger' but, often semi-literally translated as the Bigger Tiger by Equestrian soldiers, the Tiger II combined the thick armour of the Tiger I with the sloped armour used on the Panther medium tank. The tank weighed almost seventy metric tons, and was the first to use Thaumatic Sabot rounds, making it able of penetrating nearly anything."

SEV_light_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "Towed guns which were assigned to the infantry gun companies of motorised infantry regiments had difficulties keeping up with tanks during combat.

SEV_light_tank_equipment_1:0 "Panzerkampfwagen I"
SEV_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Panzer I was a light tank produced in Changeling Lands in the 1000's, and the first of many tanks to have Dieter's influence. Design of the Panzer I began in 1005 and some production began in 1006. Intended only as a training tank to introduce the concept of armoured warfare to the Changeling Heer, the PzKpfw I found use anyways as a stopgap until more advanced tanks could be produced."
SEV_light_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Panzer I"
SEV_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen II"
SEV_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Panzer II was originally designed as a second stopgap, but was found to be capable enough to function as a frontline tank, and thus entered mass production regardless. A number of issues caused by immature doctrine were pre-empted and solved, and then a whole host of new ones were added because the nation had started mass-producing cars within the last decade and this was much more complicated."

SEV_light_tank_equipment_3:0 "VK 1602 Leopard"
SEV_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The VK1602 Leopard was a planned Changeling reconnaissance vehicle designed in 1012. However, what was turned in was an armored car with a rocket launcher taped to the top as a protest against severe budget cuts. This proved to be more economical, so the design was accepted, causing the director to go mad and light the blueprints on fire. This is not that design."

SEV_medium_tank_aa_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Flakpanzer IV 'Ostwind' was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun based on the Panzer IV tank. It was developed in 1012 as a successor to the earlier Flakpanzer IV. The Panzer IV's turret was removed and replaced with an open-top, hexagonal turret which housed a 3.7 cm FlaK 43. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but this was not possible due to the heavy smoke generated by the gun."

SEV_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Sd.Kfz. 138/1 Grille was a Self-Propelled Artillery Piece that was used by Changelings during Invasion of Equestria. They were popular in Panzer divisions fighting in rough terrain. The name comes from the fact that the radiator was replaced with a smaller, cheaper version, not realizing the weight wasn't much different from the normal chassis. The engine block could be used to cook meat."

SEV_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "Panzerkampfwagen III"
SEV_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "From the start, the plan was for the martial industry to teethe on Panzer I and II's before transferring to the real threats:\nThe Panzer III and IV were to be similar designs, with the III specialized for fighting infantry with a stubby HE-thrower and the IV for fighting armor with a long cannon, with both able to play the role of the other in a pinch. Which they did, especially in the later war."

SEV_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen IV"
SEV_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed with a long 75mm "Kwaker" anti-tank gun as its primary armament, the Panzer IV was the main battle tank of the Heer for much of the war, and never truly left service.\nIt is now remembered for two unique abilities: being up-armored once a year until the engine and transmission were no longer reliable, and being misidentified as a Tiger regularly."

SEV_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "Panzerkampfwagen V Panther"
SEV_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Panther is the common name of a medium tank deployed by Changelings from mid-1014. It was intended as a counter to the Stalliongradian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside the heavier Tiger tank. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks ever created."

SEV_magical_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Changeling's first attempt at a magic weapon was, predictably, an unusual attempt. Rather than trying to launch spells, or bolts of concentrated mana, the T-10 used magical impulse to create directed arcs of lightning. However, this version suffered issues, such as sustained fire causing the entire thing to melt, serious distance issues with accuracy and power, and the need for eye protection."

SEV_magical_equipment_2_desc:0 "The TEK-13 was much more stable than its predecessor. The melting problem was grealy lessened, and by pumping more power into it more efficiently, the effective range increased as well. Of note was the selector switch, or 'fun button', that allowed continuous fire for anti-vehicle use."

Minaturization allowed for in-built thaumatic braiding, greatly increasing the stability over range, while 'continuous' mode was replaced with 'flicker', which was much more sustainable. The other effect of thaumatic braiding, light inversion, was also present, which necessitated yet more special eye protection but looked beautiful on camera."

Due to their use of electricity, previous iterations could be nullfiied by Fair Day meshes, which were so easy to work with that they could even be used as personal armor. This model had a magical sorting mechanism to allow it to only aim at 'animated' things, meaning living beings, but also vehicles."

Between the two, miles of land and an inch of protective glass.\nNearly a dozen scientists and engineers were watching, but they didn't get to push the custom-made giant red button with a skull painted on it. The head theoretician hung up his phone just as a buzzer went off, and said, "We are go for operations. Start when ready." Before he could finish saying the last sentence, the Queen slammed down on the button with all her might, causing a brilliant teal flash from the tower.\nThe theoretician was torn between concern at the spectacular size of the weapon's effect, and the fact that the Queen was staring at it, jaw hanging open limply in adoration.

Lyctia, PhD. in Biolinguistics, recipient of the 1003 Queen's Highest Excellence in Progress award for his work both discovering and unraveling Greneclyfian, former Generalmajor of the 3rd "Lyctidia" division and current Kommandant of all Vhy personnel in the Severyana Protectorate, looked out the window of his new thirteenth-floor office, once of the most significant rooms in the world, and wished he was home.\n\nIt wasn't the fact that now he was working with Prandialists so closely that Stalliongrad was split between the two factions, although he wasn't a fan. It wasn't the noise outside his office, as construction workers added new walls where the Palace of the Soviets was bisected by the lines on the map. It wasn't the fact that he was in the Palace of the Soviets at all, in the office which used to belong to the General Secretary and hadn't been completely picked clean. It was that he wasn't sure why he was in charge of a nation. All he knew was that he had been chosen by the Queen, apparently personally, and had to make do.\n\nOutside his window was Stalliongrad, although the name was already on the path to being changed, like the city itself. It had been torn apart by its conquest, and the Prandialists, barbarians as usual, were keeping it in pieces. The only reason the gunfire had stopped was that they had started to find shooting boring. Supposedly, part of his job was keeping them restrained and in this country, but he didn't have a clue how. At least he had time to figure it out.\n\nHis idle wondering was interrupted by the tremendous crash of a changeling on a chair falling through the ceiling. It was Urbiates, his liaison wit the Prandialists, who was lying on the floor in pain. "It's not bolted to the floor, Urbiates... It just needs some time with a chisel, Urbiates..." He groaned. "Oh, hey, Rosin." He continued."

We're just figuring our way around this place."\n\nRosin didn't bother to get out of his chair. "It's 'Kommandant' Rosin. What the hell are you wearing?"\n\nUrbiates grasped at his coat. "Oh, we found this upstairs. Apparently it's from Bronze Hill, wherever that is. I just think it fits our branding. Look, it's even got our symbol! Kind of! And since I'm here... Hey, Octy! That guy I was telling you about is down here!"\n\nA smaller changeling wearing a stolen Red Army uniform floated down through the hole. "The gay one?"\n\n"Yeah, that one." Urbiates shook like a dog, causing pieces of plaster to fall out of his jacket.\n\n'Octy' landed and held his hoof out over the desk. "Octopxhbin, at your service. Got to ask, did it hurt when you fell out of someone's ass?"\n\nRosin stared at him. "Charmed. Did it hurt when you got deported from your own home country?"\n\nOcty looked confused. "I... wait, how did you know about that?"\n\n"You do a remarkable job hiding your Greneclyfian accent considering you don't hide your name, but I can still make out your dennite drawl on top of it, and I can put two and two together. Now get out of here, I have actual work to do." Rosin explained.\n\n"Alright, if you insist. Have a good day, comrade budski." Urbiates said as he left through the office's front door. Octy followed, sticking his tongue out at Rosin. Then the office is as it was, barring the debris in the center and the hole in the ceiling.\n\nThe thing he wanted to do least was deal with those two, but he had to. Urbiates was the only Prandialist of note who he could regularly communicate with, which had always been the case, and neither faction could subdue the entirety of Severyana on their own. If he couldn't live with them, they would all die without them."

Normally, they spent a while having a place for them found by the bureaucracy in and around the Palace, which already had the upper ranks filled. As such, they were usually abstract to Rosin, high in the thirteenth floor Kommandant's office. If they weren't, they would simply appear in his area. It's why it was actually fairly unusual that someone got fast-tracked high enough up the ranks that he appeared in that very office. But there he was, saying "Unterkapitan Jenom, at your service, sir."\n\nRosin put down the set of papers detailing the rest of the continent's goings-on. "Oh? Who are you?"\n\n"Unterkapitan Jenom, sir." The other changeling replied. He was a royal, tall and proud and with their long hair in a bright red.\n\nRosin barely kept the annoyance off his face. "I heard you the first time, I'm asking why you were told to see me directly."\n\nSitting in the seat across the desk and adopting a terrible posture, Jenom replied, "I'm the one who was organizing anti-partisan activities in the Southern region until it was given independence. Now that they have their own structures for it, I've been sent here to assist your own counter-terror dealings." He pulled out a toothpick and started cleaning between his teeth. "I think you'll find that I was very effective."\n\nRosin decided to not mention that the article he had been reading was on a changeling governor in the Southern Protectorate who had been tortured to death by their biggest domestic rebel group last week. It must have fallen apart very quickly without Jenom's intervention. "Well, I'm glad to have you, Unterkapitan. I'll get you placed in charge of counter-terror operations, and find an office for you."\n\nJenom grinned. "This will be the beginning of a very productive relationship. Trust me.""

She'll keep you safe, she'll keep you informed, and she can't be replaced, so if you can't protect her you need to send her back to us!"\n\n"Okay! What is she?" Rosin yelled back, barely able to hear himself think.\n\n"She's a reader! She reads other creatures! That's why we need her back, so also send her over if you don't need her anymore!" The officer explained. His hat nearly blew off in the wind.\n\n"I don't know what a reader is! Can you have the pilot turn the engine off so that we can talk in peace? I can't hear myself think!" Rosin replied.\n\n"No, it's fine, we'll be out of here in a second!" The officer shouted back. "The most important part is that she can tell when a changeling is disguised just by being within the same room! That's such a big deal that if the airport here ever takes damage, you need to get her to a different town so that it won't stop her from being able to leave!" He turned and got back onto the stairs up to the passenger compartment. The submachinegun-armed guard who had been watching got out of his way as he turned around to finally yell, "She can describe how it works better! Just don't get her killed because we'll want her back at some point!"\n\nAs he closed the door and the propellers spun up, Rosin waved a guard over, and the two pulled the confused blind girl away from the plane that was already moving to the runway to take off again. He already wished that they had taken the time to explain what exactly they had dropped on him as support, since he had it in his grasp and he knew barely more than last week when he was told "someone is being sent over".

You've been given to us to help deal with the Prandialists."\n\n"Oh..." She replied sadly. "I was hoping I was somewhere else."\n\n"It's fine," Rosin explained. "You'll be given the best accommodations we can without risking your safety. You'll probably live a wealthier life here than wherever you are from. Can you tell me about yourself? The Queen seems to think you're very valuable."\n\nTarea paused. "Well, I'm a reader. I can see beings, and I can... well, I can see them when they're behind something that doesn't hide them." She looked at him, or at least in his direction as she was still wearing the blindfold. "I can see that you're there, but I can't see your face, or your eyes, just your existence. And if you were disguised, I'd see that, too, like a sheet over a piece of furniture. Before you ask, I don't know what's under the sheet, just that it's covering something. I can't tell existences apart, you and the guard and the driver look the same to me."\n\nRosin exhaled. "Well, that still kind of is a big deal. Color me impressed. Is there anything else?"\n\n"Yeah." She began. "As part of my enchantment, I'm not allowed to see violence, wear black, or have anything but water on the eighth day of the Royal week. Those shouldn't be hard for you, though."\n\nThe car pulled into the underground garage of the Palace. "We can manage," Rosin said, wondering how she survived without black."

severyana_a.6.d:0 "The door to Rosin's office banged loudly. Then it banged again. The handle turned, and Urbiates entered. "See? It's unlocked." He explained to Octy. He caught sight of Tarea, who was sitting in the corner, and loudly said "What are you doing hanging with this nerd? He's not even into women, you know."\n\n"Do not touch her. She is my daughter." Rosin annoyedly replied.\n\n"Yours, or your wife's?" Urbiates asked.\n\n"Mine. Her parents were friends of mine, and they died, so I've taken her in. It's the right thing to do, although I know that concept gives you trouble." Rosin lied.\n\nUrbiates mimed wiping a tear from his eye. "How touching. Anyways, we came to say that we've found a weird thing and we want you to have it because we're too lazy to take it apart." A collection of pictures fell onto the table, along with a stained napkin with an address written on it.\n\nRosin picked up one of the photos and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was at least fifty percent useful information. It was some sort of brick oval in the middle of a warehouse, covered in warnings. Naturally, Octy was licking it in the picture. "That is interesting, actually. I'll send a team out."\n\n"That's all we have for now, I'm glad to say." Urbiates finished. He handed a note to Tarea and whispered, "call me" before leaving.\n\nOnce the door was closed for a bit, Rosin asked, "So, did you see anything?"\n\n"The one who did all the talking, I don't know who he was, but it wasn't who you saw." She whispered. She turned her head down to her hoof, which had his note in it. "Also, did he think I could read this?"

severyana_a.7.d:0 "In front of Rosin, a line of ponies stood dull and senseless. Sometimes they stepped forwards. The one at the front sometimes received a loaf of bread from the one behind the table and left the line, the life flowing back into them now that they could resume their day. Two black-clad Vhy soldiers stood watch, in case anyone thought that they could make one right move and drag away a week’s worth of food, Prandialists included. It was a common sight in the urban areas, and had been ever since the famine.\n\n”It’s actually things like this that are the big question,” the scrawny changeling continued. “Every pony has an opinion on whether we should maintain the Stalliongradian state-controlled economy or allow for individual entrepreneurship. It’s fairly split.”\n\n”I can imagine. What do you recommend?” Rosin asked.\n\n”Don’t do it, if we control the economy then we control the entire country. Even the parts owned by the Prandialists.” Jenome chimed in. “We won’t be able to enforce anything under a free market. We won’t even know who to call.”\n\n”Well, sort of.” The other changeling cleaned his glasses against his coat. “But there are ways to control even the freest market. We’d know who was rich, obviously. The major benefit is that we wouldn’t have to maintain anything ourselves if we didn’t have a reason to. We can always undo it later if some field demands it, too.”\n\nRosin rubbed his chin. Another pony shuffled out of the line. Every one of them wasn’t working, yet they were still maintaining themselves. It was inefficient, but that wasn’t bad. If they had to fix it, they’d find a better way, but Rosin wasn’t sure that his state could keep track of who held power and who didn’t… or that they could keep the system running if they ran it themselves."

A giant portrait of Queen Chrysalis hung behind him, covering what was once a grand mural of the Winter Revolution’s founders, sans Trimmel and friends. His friends in the benches and seats were nearly all officers who were busy looking sheepish. “So? Does anyone want to explain why nobody thought this was important?” Most of the room was trying to avoid looking at him. “The fatherland hasn’t sent us food since we arrived and nobody thought to mention that? Come on. Have our soldiers even been eating?”\n\n”It’s not a critical issue yet,” yelled one of the officers. “We have plenty of love, and the ponies we got it from are still made of meat. We can eat them.”\n\nRosin pressed his hoof into his face. “We are building our new order, here! We are not eating our future workforce when we could just make them catch fish!”\n\nAnother officer spoke up. “We’re already instituting fish catching and farming programs, it will just take a year before they can sustainably feed us.”\n\n”Okay!” Rosin shouted. “So it’s not a total disaster. What can we do to keep our armies fed for one year? Suggestions?”\n\nJenom stood up. “Our work camp program is proceeding well. Soon it will begin to suffer the planned attrition. If we increase the processing rate, we can sustain ourselves off of the dead prisoners and increase productivity.”\n\nIvl Meknasti also stood up. “We don’t need to boost our bodycount just to make our ends meet! We already process a substantial number of ponies through our normal anti-partisan activities. In our raids and especially executions, we can merely collect the bodies and use those as our extra food.” Meknasti puffed out his chest with pride. “It would even boost morale in the field if our soldiers knew that they were catching their own food on such operations, which are dreary and soul-crushing otherwise.”\n\nTwo good solutions, as far as Rosin was concerned."

severyana_a.9.d:0 "The car passed a sign. It said, “Welcome to [Vhy] Prison [Deltapolis].” Portions of it had been covered in engraved metal sheets to hide names from the Stalliongradian government that built the facility. Rosin had to tip his hat to the Marksists, they knew how to get rid of the folks they didn’t like. It was a shame their biology didn’t let them use every part of the malfeasant.\n\nDeltapolis, like many similar facilities, was being converted so that the inmates’ processing didn’t end with them being worked to death. When they became too exhausted to continue, they would be taken into a side chamber, exposed to a lethal dosage of gas, and mechanically drained of love before being sent to the corpse pit. If needed, the gas could be washed off the meat and that could also be consumed. The purpose of Rosin’s visit was to arrive shortly before the extra sections were activated.\n\nHis car arrived just behind a new group of prisoners, from unemployed bums to partisans. The prison owner met him and led him to a raised balcony where much of the complex of trenches and mines could be seen. “Inmates of Vorkuta, now called Deltapolis!” He called out. Some prisoners stopped and looked at the new voice, and as they were not beaten by the guards for it, more joined them. “I have come to you with an offer! Many of you have been scorned by your old masters, and new service under the Vhy for the good of the Severyanan Protectorate is an ample way to not only avenge yourself but to crawl out of this hole!” By now, nearly all eyes were on him. “Those of you who wish to come with me, simply step forward!”\n\nThe prisoners stared. Then they looked at each other, and to the prisoners on their other side. There was a bit of murmuring, and the biggest one drove his pick back into the dirt, and soon every one was back to work.\n\nOh well. If they regretted it, they would only do so for a year or two."

But we were far away from the Politburo, and a lot of my old subordinates got some ideas.” He lit the end and offered another one to Rosin, who declined. “I think I could get a lot of them back if I had some encouragement.

Every ten splits lets you split another Special division."
SEV_3rd_div:0 "3rd "Lyctida" Division"
SEV_3rd_div_desc:0 "Infantry with heavy self-propelled artillery support.\n\nEmblem: Golden Spiral\n\nPressed into frontline service from its defensive role, the newly-expanded security force was given heavy artillery and a new commanding officer: Doctor Rosin Lyctia, a personal friend of Captain Dieter Heinrich and respected researcher. It's combat record under his command was generally average, and the force never did anything as significant as it's role in the 1005 chaos, which is when the division was first noticed for its radical streak."
SEV_4th_div:0 "4th "Rot" Division"
SEV_4th_div_desc:0 "Infantry with some anti-tank, artillery, and anti-air, plus medium tank destroyers.\n\nEmblem: Exponential Growth Curve\n\nThe Vhy 4th Division was originally Lyctidan, but after it was destroyed in its first battle, the name was turned over to the largest pony collaborator force. The ponies of the "Rot", or the N.O.E., were an eclectic group of outcasts and ex-convicts who took whatever they could salvage and had little respect for the Queen's rules of war. Somehow, their strange mix of stolen equipment kept them alive no matter how many times they were used as cannon fodder."
SEV_7th_div:0 "7th "Blodtruppen" Division"
SEV_7th_div_desc:0 "Mechanized infantry with a bias towards anti-tank ability.\n\nEmblem: Axe in a Pony Skull\n\nOne of the few Vhy divisions recruited from a specific hive that wasn't Lyctidia, the Vraksians of the 7th "Blodtruppen" weren't known for their extremism or bloodlust. In spite of this, the division was responsible for a substantial number of massacres, exterminations, and general failure to follow orders, which their officers always claimed to be freak accidents caused by individual soldiers making logical errors in the field."
SEV_9th_div:0 "9th "Mercury" Division"
SEV_9th_div_desc:0 "Motorized with artillery.\n\nEmblem: Tangent Lines\n\nStarting out as a brigade, the 9th "Mercury" was boosted by its commander being related to the manager of a car factory. When Vhy brigades began to be expanded to full-sized divisions to fill the holes, the one which was already entirely motorized (kind of) was one of the first. During the war, it recieved some of the most notorious orders of the war and carried each one out dutifully. This unlucky streak left the division with a terrible reputation that still persists."
SEV_11th_div:0 "11th "Monarchin" Division"
SEV_11th_div_desc:0 "Motorized with some extra armor for support.\n\nEmblem: Long S\n\nOne of the Vhy's signaturely large military police units that was rebranded to a field division, the changelings of this unit were forever marked by their early days as soldiers, when they made up for their lack of training with a brutality that had been acceptable against anti-government activists yet was thorougly banned against the armies of the nations the changeling state wanted to rule peacefully. In time, they learned how to fight properly, but by then they had a reputation... and a tradition."
SEV_14th_div:0 "14th "Ein Verdammte Schneeflocke" Division"
SEV_14th_div_desc:0 "Stormtroopers with some support companies.\n\nEmblem: Hexagon\n\nDrawn from the entire nation, this division, made up primarily of the herding class, was supposed to be forest specialists first rather than urban or fort specialists who were given extra training to be somewhat adept in woodland. Results were disappointing, with no real benefit compared to the normal Jager and Storm Team programs, and the division was constantly implicated for disobeying orders to not eat prisoners, but it was competent enough that it survived the war as an organization."
SEV_18th_div:0 "18th "Fanatiker" Division"
SEV_18th_div_desc:0 "Medium armor with mechanized and support SPAA.\n\nEmblem: Astrological H\n\nOf the Vhy's divisions, the 18th is quite possibly the most ideologically motivated. Slavishly loyal to Queen Chrysalis, this division, many of whom were drawn from the Chrysalis Youth, are consequently the most chivalrous to their enemies. However, they also have gotten into shooting conflicts with their own allies for "insufficient zeal", and famously once saw the soldiers execute a Lieutenant for cowardice for ordering a retreat in spite of the high command."

SEV_25th_div_desc:0 "Infantry with artillery.\n\nEmblem: Eight-Legged Changeling\n\nDespite starting out as a brigade within the 15th "Stahlschwarm", the 25th Brigade was split off as its own entity to defend occupied coastland. While there, it soon found itself fending off an Equestrian offensive, which it managed by conscripting the local pegasi to create the ideal winds for an attack by fire that proved decisive. The commander was awarded handsomely for defending the town against six times as many soldiers on short notice, but the brutal methods secretly gained him another kind of attention."
SEV_28th_div:0 "28th "Princip" Brigade"
SEV_28th_div_desc:0 "Infantry with engineers.\n\nEmblem: Olenian Flag\n\nNo single unit within the Changeling Armed Forces has managed to be so grotesque yet so long-lived as the "Princip" Brigade. Formed in Olenia when a desperate governor conscripted the local prison population to aid in the defence of his region, they quickly defected to the Heer, who constantly shuffled them around to keep anyone from noticing that they were absolutely useless at everything and were mostly an alternate death sentance for Olenians. They have now been passed on to the Vhy specifically so that they could be sent to Severyana."
SEV_militia:0 "Prandialist Militia"
SEV_militia_desc:0 "Infantry with motorized and some AA.\n\nEmblem: N/A\n\nMilitias created from whatever is available is a staple of the Prandialist way of warfare, which generally advises against direct confrontation and instead encourages demographic victories. Still, they can be thrown against real opponents if they have to be, and sometimes they even win.
