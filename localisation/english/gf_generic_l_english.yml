equus_events.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]A recent wave of threats, army actions, and street brawls initiated by far-right elements in Pingland have resulted in nearly all moderate and far-left politicians losing power or fleeing the country. The government has, of all things, joined in Alliance with the Changelings, supposedly to prevent counter-revolution. Many outside the country theorize that much of political society, including the upper echelons of power, were infiltrated by changeling agents in order to cause this turn of events, but there are few left who would fight back within the nation itself."

These turned from petty disputes into organized violence and then a march on the government itself. At this point, the nation's moderate and far-right elements have been driven out of politics, if not the country, and the new worker's government has allied the nation with Stalliongrad. Reporters on the scene claim to have noticed a great many Stalliongradian soldiers assisting the revolutionaries, and of those who remain to question the government, many accuse it of being sold out to that nation, but nothing can be done now."

While at first decried as a simple power-grab, weapons and creatures from foreign powers were uncovered, sometimes before destroying the orders from their governments telling them to cause some chaos or other. Although the nation found itself at risk of being destroyed by larger brethren on the continent, the crisis has been averted. For now, Pingland remains in control of its own destiny."
