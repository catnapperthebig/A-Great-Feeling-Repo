After military units loyal to the Council were mobilized and Highhill arrested, leftist politicians were quick to blame the percieved weakness of the more moderate Council members, sometimes with quite strong language, and many of those accused have since fled the country for fear of repression.

On the way, his column of loyal soldiers was stopped by barricades and protests from citizens and police, slowing their progress enough that military formations loyal to the Council could arrive, surround, and arrest the entire lot. There were no fatalities, except for in one district, where a steel worker's union attempted to fight against the soldiers directly and were shot to pieces. It was only the discipline of every creature involved that the gun battle didn't spread beyond there, and for their aggressive rhetoric that praised such actions as necessary to stop the coup, many leftist political figures have since been disgraced as violent radicals.
