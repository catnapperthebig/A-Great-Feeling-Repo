CHN_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Karabiner 98k"
CHN_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Early Changeling designs for bolt-action rifles were often confused and unreliable. The Karabiner 98, along with the rest of the project to create an infantry loadout to Dieter's design, wound up being the first to work well when properly mass-produced. The rifle would be the mainstay of the Heer until the end of the war."
CHN_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Gewehr mod. 1007"
CHN_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Gewehr 7"
CHN_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "Dieter's plans proved to be a good blueprint, but they weren't designed with any normal race in mind. Modifications to the infantryman's kit to take advantage of new discoveries quickly found themelves in order, and the Changeling military obsession with grenades began to appear."
CHN_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Machinenpistole 1010"
CHN_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "MP 90"
CHN_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The MP-80 project, unexpectedly, was one of the first new-generation Changeling firearms completed, being that Dieter already had a working model to pattern off of. Finding their place in the doctrine, however, took much longer, as Changeling officers didn't trust the diminutive cartridge at first, but it would eventually become the most iconic Changeling weapon of the war."
CHN_infantry_equipment_3:0 "StormRifle 1013"
CHN_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "SR 13"
CHN_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The StormRifle marked a turning point in weapons developement. It was the first time the desire came before the design, although there was still much inspiration. Sadly, the forward-thinking design came with too many mechanical quirks to be a standard weapon."
CHN_infantry_equipment_x:0 "Stormrifle 1019"
CHN_infantry_equipment_x_short:0 "SR 19"
CHN_infantry_equipment_x_desc:0 "The most mature Changeling infantry loadout came in 1019, during the Second Hearthswarming Crisis, where, at the height of their power, the Second Wehrmacht gave this rifle to certain high-value units. Underbarrel attachments were very common in this pattern, which made it expensive."
CHN_infantry_equipment_x_2:0 "Project-Ultra Rifle 25"
CHN_infantry_equipment_x_2_short:0 "PUR"
CHN_infantry_equipment_x_2_desc:0 "Although it never had widespread adoption, this rifle was well-known for its place in the kill-teams fielded by MONOCOL during the later Succession Years. The other implements of destruction were similarly-regarded, especially because so much power was given to tunnel-clearers"

CHN_gw_tank_equipment:0 "Power Cracker X"
CHN_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Although conventional history says that tanks were first fielded during the Stalliongradian revolt, many creatures (nearly all of them Changelings) would argue that the true first usage was a kind of mobile cannon favored during the later Unification Wars. The Power Cracker was an evolution on that design, most notable for having an engine instead of holes in the floor. It never saw use before the Panzers became dominant."

CHN_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2:0 "Sturmtiger"
CHN_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_short:0 "Sturmtiger"
CHN_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Sturmtiger was a siege mortar built into a Tiger hull. Despite this being an offensive weapon made during a defensive war, it made a name for itself in the Major Offensive. By day, the armor protected them from counterbatteries, and by night, the job was done by the ghostly wails coming from the barrel when the breach was left open and the crew inside snored, which caused attacking ponies to retreat out of fear."
CHN_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3:0 "Geschützwagen Tiger"
CHN_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "Based on the hull of a King Tiger, it was to be able to mount a 170mm K 72 L/50 gun. However, the sole prototype built was destroyed when it was used as cover when the factory designing it fell under attack."

CHN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1:0 "Linebreaker T2 Canoe"
CHN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Linebreaker T6 Canoe was an early version of the Linebreaker that held a heavy artillery piece in the bed. Although it was intended to be the main gun, it could still be pitched up, and this was its most useful configuration. The nickname came from the open top of the long, now-flat design."

CHN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_2:0 "Panzerjäger Tiger (CM)"
CHN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Elefant (Elephant) was a heavy tank destroyer based on the chassis of the cancelled Carapace Motors Tiger Project and fitted with an 88 mm Panzerabwehrkanone 43/2 gun."

CHN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3:0 "Panzerjäger Tiger Ausf. B"
CHN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Jagdtiger was the heaviest armoured fighting vehicle operationally used by Changeling Heer. The vehicle carried a 128 mm PaK 44 L/55 main gun, and carried heavy frontal armour."
CHN_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_short:0 "Jagdtiger"
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "Linebreaker"
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Linebreaker program was a series of prototypes designed to combine Dieter's high-mobility armored assault strategy with a more old-styled focus on special high-energy designs. However, magic and industry function on different rules, and the resulting designs were scrapped for being unable to do anything extremely well and being horribly expensive."
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Linebreaker"
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger"
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Tiger I was a Changeling heavy tank developed in 1012 as an answer to the unexpectedly impressive Stalliongradian armour encountered in the initial months of the Changeling invasion of the Equestria, particularly the T-34 and the KV-1. To this end, it did its job masterfully whenever it wasn't suffering some sort of technical issue, which it usually was."
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Tiger"
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_3:0 "Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausf. B Tiger II"
CHN_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Known under the informal name 'Trnir-Tiger' but, often semi-literally translated as the Bigger Tiger by Equestrian soldiers, the Tiger II combined the thick armour of the Tiger I with the sloped armour used on the Panther medium tank. The tank weighed almost seventy metric tons, and was the first to use Thaumatic Sabot rounds, making it able of penetrating nearly anything."

CHN_light_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "Towed guns which were assigned to the infantry gun companies of motorised infantry regiments had difficulties keeping up with tanks during combat. The easiest solution was to modify a spare tank chassis to carry it into battle. In the case of the Bison, it uses the chassis of the Panzer I."

CHN_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_short:0 "JagdLeopard"
CHN_light_tank_equipment_1:0 "Panzerkampfwagen I"
CHN_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Panzer I was a light tank produced in Changeling Lands in the 1000's, and the first of many tanks to have Dieter's influence. Design of the Panzer I began in 1005 and some production began in 1006. Intended only as a training tank to introduce the concept of armoured warfare to the Changeling Heer, the PzKpfw I found use anyways as a stopgap until more advanced tanks could be produced."
CHN_light_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Panzer I"
CHN_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen II"
CHN_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Panzer II was originally designed as a second stopgap, but was found to be capable enough to function as a frontline tank, and thus entered mass production regardless. A number of issues caused by immature doctrine were pre-empted and solved, and then a whole host of new ones were added because the nation had started mass-producing cars within the last decade and this was much more complicated."
CHN_light_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Panzer II"
CHN_light_tank_equipment_3:0 "VK 1602 Leopard"
CHN_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The VK1602 Leopard was a planned Changeling reconnaissance vehicle designed in 1012. However, what was turned in was an armored car with a rocket launcher taped to the top as a protest against severe budget cuts. This proved to be more economical, so the design was accepted, causing the director to go mad and light the blueprints on fire. This is not that design."

CHN_medium_tank_aa_equipment_1:0 "Flakpanzer III Möbelwagen"
CHN_medium_tank_aa_equipment_1_desc:0 "Nicknamed Möbelwagen because of its boxy turret when closed, it was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun built from the chassis of the Panzer III tank and armed with a 20mm quad-gun."

CHN_medium_tank_aa_equipment_2:0 "Flakpanzer IV Ostwind"
CHN_medium_tank_aa_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Flakpanzer IV 'Ostwind' was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun based on the Panzer IV tank. It was developed in 1012 as a successor to the earlier Flakpanzer IV. The Panzer IV's turret was removed and replaced with an open-top, hexagonal turret which housed a 3.7 cm FlaK 43. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but this was not possible due to the heavy smoke generated by the gun."
CHN_medium_tank_aa_equipment_2_short:0 "Ostwind"
CHN_medium_tank_aa_equipment_3:0 "Flakpanzer Coelian"
CHN_medium_tank_aa_equipment_3_desc:0 "Flakpanzer Coelian was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun design by KLA Arsenal in 1014 for the Changeling armed forces. It was intended to be armed with two 3.7 cm FlaK 43 gun in a fully enclosed, rotating turret on the hull of a Panther medium tank."

CHN_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_1:0 "Grille"
CHN_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Sd.Kfz. 138/1 Grille was a Self-Propelled Artillery Piece that was used by Changelings during Invasion of Equestria. They were popular in Panzer divisions fighting in rough terrain. The name comes from the fact that the radiator was replaced with a smaller, cheaper version, not realizing the weight wasn't much different from the normal chassis. The engine block could be used to cook meat."

CHN_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_1:0 "Sturmgeschütz III"
CHN_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Sturmgeschütz III assault gun was the Changeling's most produced armoured fighting vehicle during invasion of Equestria. It was built on the chassis of the proven Panzer III tank. Initially intended as a mobile, armoured light gun for infantry support, the StuG was continually modified and was widely employed as a tank destroyer."

CHN_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2:0 "Jagdpanzer IV"
CHN_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Jagdpanzer IV served in the anti-tank sections of Panzer divisions. They were very successful tank destroyers but performed badly when used out of role as substitutes for tanks or assault guns."

CHN_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3:0 "Jagdpanther"
CHN_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Jagdpanther was a tank destroyer built on the chassis of the Panther tank. It entered service late in 1014. The Jagdpanther combined the very powerful 8.8 cm PaK 43 cannon of the Tiger II and the characteristically excellent armour and suspension of the Panther chassis."
CHN_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_short:0 "Jagdpanther"
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "Panzerkampfwagen III"
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1005, General Vect understood two general tank roles to act as the most numerous equipment for the future Changeling Panzer Divisions. The first one eventually fell to the Panzerkampfwagen III design, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion for its ability to swat armor. The second one became the Panzerkampfwagen IV."
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Panzer III"
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen IV"
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armour - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the difference in industrial output becoming apparent and in the face of Stalliongradian T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed Changeling tank, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Panzer IV"
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "Panzerkampfwagen V Panther"
CHN_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Panther is the common name of a medium tank deployed by Changelings from mid-1014. It was intended as a counter to the Stalliongradian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside the heavier Tiger tank. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks ever created."

CHN_modern_tank_equipment_x_desc:0 "The Standardpanzer series was an attempt by Changelings to produce a standardised, modern, and domestic series of tank designs that has started in 1016. There were to be standard designs in three different weight classes. The Standardpanzer-50 was intended as a standard medium tank, replacing the Panther and Tiger tank series and the conversions based on those tanks."

Due to their use of electricity, previous iterations could be nullfiied by Fair Day meshes, which were so easy to work with that they could even be used as personal armor. This model had a magical sorting mechanism to allow it to only aim at 'animated' things, meaning living beings, but also vehicles."

nuke_first.1.d_changeling_fascism:0 "Queen Chrysalis sat in the bunker, staring eagerly across the open field. In the far distance, a speck, a tower carrying a steel oval, sat. Between the two, miles of land and an inch of protective glass.\nNearly a dozen scientists and engineers were watching, but they didn't get to push the custom-made giant red button with a skull painted on it. The head theoretician hung up his phone just as a buzzer went off, and said, "We are go for operations. Start when ready." Before he could finish saying the last sentence, the Queen slammed down on the button with all her might, causing a brilliant teal flash from the tower.\nThe theoretician was torn between concern at the spectacular size of the weapon's effect, and the fact that the Queen was staring at it, jaw hanging open limply in adoration. Such a massive explosion, such a noise - and it left behind a poison that her own changelings were nearly immune to. It was perfect."

Every changeling in the country shall know the face and voice of their benevolent Queen. The changeling folk need a strong ruler in these uncertain times. Only under the leadership of Queen Chrysalis can our race know unity and prosperity."
CHN_support_workers:0 "Aid For Worker Families"
CHN_support_workers_desc:0 "Millions of changelings are working hard to ensure the future of the nation. They are the ones responsible for supplying the military with everything it needs, and they are the foundation of our upcoming victory.

CHN_state_propaganda:0 "Final Propaganda Wave"
CHN_state_propaganda_desc:0 "The propaganda machine has been in motion since 1002, after Chrysalis' failed invasion of Equestria. Now the situation has calmed down.

We will only prevail by working together."
hive_funding:0 "Broad Support of Smaller Hives"
hive_funding_desc:0 "While the great and teeming hives of Vesalipolis, Vraks, Ditrysium, Soryth and Lyctida are mighty centers of industry, countless minor hives are scattered across our territory.

In return, we expect them to make their contribution for the nation."
Expansion_of_newhives:0 "Continue Hive Modernisation"
Expansion_of_newhives_desc:0 "Due to our isolation and sanctions imposed by Equestria, many hives have fallen behind in economic and societal development.

Public projects and savvy investments will turn dilapidated and backwards caverns into shining, efficient and modern hives."
steel_industry:0 "Vraksian Steelworks"
steel_industry_desc:0 "Northern mountains are rich in iron ore. However, to use it efficiently, means of transport across the country and processing plants will have to be built. The military hive of Vraks is the ideal location for the latter, as the Vraksians will be able to quickly refine the steel into weapons of war. Commoragh will be overseeing the project and guarantees the Queen that it will be finished on schedule."

CHN_soryth:0 "Soryth"
CHN_soryth_desc:0 "Soryth, the hive-city which lies on the hilly shores of the Key Lake, is a solemn northern hive with the only magical university in the country. To further improve our magical research capabilities, crystal mines will be opened nearby. With enough funding, Queen Yaria and the university will be able to assist in our study of magic, allowing its wider application in warfare."

send_spies_to_EQS_desc:0 "The lessons learned from our previous invasion of Canterlot have been painful, but insightful. During this war, proper reconnaissance of our enemies' industrial and military capacities will not only be beneficial, but vital. Our agents can also wreak havoc among their ranks, as so far nocreature is capable of countering our shapeshifting abilities."
steal_tech:0 "Spies in High Places"
steal_tech_desc:0 "Beyond causing trouble behind enemy lines, well-placed spies can steal valuable intelligence from our enemies.

This way we can maintain our technological supremacy and prevent ourselves from falling behind our enemies."
CHN_develop_vesalipolis:0 "Vesalipolis"
CHN_develop_vesalipolis_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis has decided to develop the capital hive of Vesalipolis. We shall introduce a subway system, construct an underground factory as well as an oil refinery, and finance new construction projects in the hive-city. The largest urban area on Equus will become even greater, the envy of the entire world, a testament to the prosperity of the changeling nation."
CHN_develop_ditrysium:0 "Ditrysium"
CHN_develop_ditrysium_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis decrees that the northern naval port-city, Ditrysium, must be developed. She has ordered the construction of two naval dockyards and financing of the production of naval supplies. New railroads will be built as well, along with expanded fisheries. Queen Helvia should be grateful for this, even if the project will be done without her approval."
CHN_develop_vraks:0 "Vraks"
CHN_develop_vraks_desc:0 "Hesitantly, Queen Chrysalis demands we develop the southern military centre, Vraks. Two new military manufactories will be opened, and she will decide whether further construction projects will be initiated, or if the efficiency of pre-existing factories will be improved. Chrysalis demands we complete the project without issues, so Queen Argynnis doesn't get satisfaction from our failure."
air_research:0 "Equestrian Aircraft"

technology_centre_desc:0 "Modernisation of the capital and the central regions of the country are underway. More changelings, more opportunities. A grand research complex in northern area of the Vesalipolis hive has been under construction for several years now. In next couple of months the facilities and equipment will be moved in. Glory to changeling science!"

industrial_research_desc:0 "The core of our country requires quick modernisation in terms of transport. As more and more changelings will be coming to the capital and neighbouring cities, new routes need to be created to connect them. Railroads will be constructed both above and under the ground, providing quick, affordable and reliable transport for all. Especially the soldiers."

arctic_shelf_mining_desc:0 "The Arctic holds large quantities of minerals, including phosphate, bauxite, iron ore, copper, nickel, and most importantly, large quantities of oil that lie untapped. We must acquire these assets as soon as possible to improve our economy and to feed the unending thirst of our mighty Panzers. We will need to refine and stockpile as much fuel as possible in preparation for the future."

pressure_olenia_desc:0 "With Olenia still in its decrepit state under [OLE.GetLeader] and our military might increasing rapidly, it is time to revise the border treaty signed with King Aldar II and show the world that we are taking our rightful place as the master of Equus. By asserting our dominance over them, we will make them unlikely to resist us in the future."
offer_puppet:0 "Peaceful Integration of Olenia"
offer_puppet_desc:0 "While we could easily crush Olenia, it might be more worthwhile to propose [OLE.GetLeader] a peaceful alternative to war. By offering our 'protection' and allowing Olenians limited autonomy, we can focus our forces elsewhere. This way changeling lives will be spared and Olenia secured without a single drop of blood. Should they refuse our generous offer however, we can still have our war."
conquest:0 "Conquest of Olenia"
conquest_desc:0 "Olenia has never had any respect for us. There is no doubt that they will turn against the Changeling Lands once they are finished their internal struggles.

war_academy:0 "Finalize Reorganization"
war_academy_desc:0 "The old guard from the Canterlot Invasion failed us by using traditional methods of changeling warfare. Most of them were 'retired' after 1002, and ever since we have been filling the gaps in our officer ranks with new and fresh blood. Their young minds are full of innovative ideas on how to develop the art of war. Soon, the reorganization of our military will be complete."

prepare_for_war_desc:0 "The time to take our place at the top of the world is almost upon us. Therefore we need to finish last minute preparations for the second invasion; roads, airbases and fortifications must be constructed quickly. We will also stockpile a tremendous amount of supplies for the coming operation and begin large-scale military exercises on the border."
prepare_for_war2:0 "Roads and Air Bases"
prepare_for_war2_desc:0 "Both roads and airfields are important for any military maneuvers. Building up important infrastructure will ensure our war goes smoothly and that our soldiers remain well supplied with fresh meat and other supplies, while air bases will be needed for our airforce so it can more easily achieve air supremacy over the enemy."
prepare_for_war3:0 "Work for the Front"
prepare_for_war3_desc:0 "Ensuring we have the means to keep our armies supplied is a priority in a time of war. Building up is our only option.

With our adoption of new doctrines, we need to initiate a new training regimen for our soldiers so they can put theory to practice."
CHN_Infantry_2:0 "New Tools of Death"
CHN_Infantry_2_desc:0 "A well trained army is nothing without the firearms to back it up. Ensuring that our equipment is not only up to international standards, but surpassing them, will give our troops an edge in battle.

CHN_Jager_1_desc:0 "Jaegers predate the unification of our race. They are soldiers specialized in infiltration, using their shapeshifting abilities to breach into fortified positions and to camouflage themselves in wooded terrain. "Jaeger" means Hunter, and describes these fearsome soldiers well. However, the tactics they use are not compatible with combined arms warfare and need to be revised."
CHN_Motorized_1:0 "Motorised Equipment"
CHN_Motorized_1_desc:0 "More modern and reliable trucks and other vehicles are a necessity for any army that relies on fast movement of its forces.

With their firepower and armour, they can breach through defensive lines, and with their speed, they can quickly envelop enemy forces, forming large cauldrons that can then be destroyed by infantry. These machines of war, Queen Chrysalis believes, will be the key to our victory."
CHN_Blitzkrieg_2:0 "Panzer Modernisation"
CHN_Blitzkrieg_2_desc:0 "Continued modernisation of our armoured forces will guarantee that they will remain effectively impervious to all future threats.

Otherwise death is certain."

CHN_rehire_recina_desc:0 "The current state of the Zehr is unsatisfactory. Our Admirality is lacking proper leadership, and its pool of admirals are not nearly as capable as we'd like them to be. Queen Helvia of Ditrysium has raised a possible solution, though it is not one that enthuses Chrysalis. Former Admiral Recina, Helvia's sister, is currently languishing under house arrest, but could perhaps be convinced to return to service as a Minister of the Navy.\n\nRecina's reinstatement would upset the current Admirality (all four of them), and buying Recina's service will likely prove costly. She is still annoyed about the circumstances preceding her arrest, and only the offer of a high position in the Zehr could convince her. The disgraced admiral has proven herself in the past though, and this is perhaps one bullet worth biting if we intend to reinvigorate the Zehr."

changelings.1.t:0 "The Olenian Question"
changelings.1.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis looked at the draft of the communique she'd spent the past few hours working on. The letter would be sent to [OLE.GetLeader] regarding an awful, ill-fated treaty signed between the Changeling Lands and the long-dead King Aldar II of Olenia. That treaty had bought Queen Chrysalis and the Changeling Lands international recognition at the cost of surrendering two states to the barbaric deer of the south. But now, with Aldar dead and the illegitimate King Johan shaking up Olenian politics, it was perhaps the best opportunity Chrysalis would have to right an ignominious wrong... and the pretense to expand Changeling influence beyond the Hives' borders.\n\nThe communique was a brilliant thing. It demanded renegotiations of the peace treaty King Aldar II had signed before his death, demanding the return of the two northern changeling states to the Hives in exchange for changeling recognition of [OLE.GetLeader] as the true sovereign of Olenia. It was a reversal of the treaty signed with King Aldar, and many of Chrysalis' advisors doubted the Olenian leader would agree to it, as the last thing [OLE.GetLeader] needed to do in the midst of the Olenian civil unrest would be to sign their territory away to a foreign power. But Chrysalis didn't care what option the Olenian leader would do. Either they would return the rightful changeling territory, or they would refuse, and that would be enough pretext to wage war. Either option pleased Chrysalis, but after all the reorganization the Royal Changeling Heer had gone through after the defeat at Canterlot in 1002, she was eager to see her new military at work. No matter which way she looked at it, this communique was a win-win scenario.\n\nIt was time for the weak to fear the strong."
changelings.1.a:0 "Let's see if this prey species can realize when it's being hunted."

changelings.2.t:0 "An Olenian Protectorate?"
changelings.2.d:0 ""The situation in Olenia is favorable," Hivesmarschall Trimmel said, gesturing at a map of the deer nation spread across a table before his queen. "The country is tearing itself apart already. Most think King Johan is illegitimate, and Princess Velvet should be the rightful queen. On top of that, the Equestrians have been pushing their disgusting harmonic ways on the nation, while Stalliongrad thinks that Olenia would be better as a communist puppet in the west to outflank Equestrian advances. All of this together means the deer are at each other's throats, and the true disasters haven't even started. It would just be tragic should a foreign power as strong as the Changeling Hives decided it should swoop in and intervene."\n\n"So what are you suggesting?" Chrysalis asked. "Clearly we cannot afford to let either Equestria or Stalliongrad establish closer ties with the Olenians. They are the first domino that needs to fall to take down Equestria, and it won't do if the domino is twice as heavy."\n\n"It's simple, really," Trimmel said. "Offer the Olenians the once in a lifetime opportunity to bow before you and kiss the dirt beneath your hooves. Say that we in the Changeling Hives are worried about the state of affairs in Olenia, and are merely offering our help. And if they refuse, or rather, when they refuse, we can claim it is in our best interests to see to it that we save the deer from themselves. Either way, Olenia bends to us. It just depends on how stupid they are to tell if we need to send in the tanks or not."\n\nChrysalis thought about it for a moment, then grinned. "I like the way you think, Hivesmarschall," she said."\n\nTrimmel grinned back at her. "I like the way I think too, Your Majesty.""
changelings.2.a:0 "Let's see how the deer react to this one."

changelings.3.t:0 "Conquest" ## Empty Event ##

changelings.4.t:0 "States Ceded"
changelings.4.d:0 ""[OLE.GetLeader] truly is spineless," Chrysalis said, reading the response from Olenia with contempt. "Here I was spoiling for a good fight. And the deer fold like a house of cards. Pathetic!"\n\n"It appears reason won out in the end," Hivesmarschall Trimmel stated, bowing his head as Chrysalis fumed that she wouldn't have her fight anymore. "Still, we can call this a victory. There will be further opportunities to subjugate the deer. I'm sure the right one will surface before long."\n\n"It better," Chrysalis said. "If I settle for only taking two states off of the deer, I'm just a bit player. But if I take all of Olenia..." she rubbed her hooves together and giggled. "The deer may have bought themselves some time, but they will be my first conquest, one way or another. Soon they will submit or they will die, and I don't particularly care which one they choose.""
changelings.4.a:0 "This is good enough for now... but it won't satisfy us forever."

changelings.5.t:0 "[From.GetName] Rejects Our Demands!"
changelings.5.d:0 "Hivesmarschall Trimmel read the response of [OLE.GetLeader] with a pleased smile on his face. "Your demands that we cede Solgud Bergskedja and Feer Dalar are utterly preposterous. These lands were given to the deer by the treaty established by King Aldar II, in case you have forgotten. We will not give them back to you just because you demand them. Olenia does not cower before bullies." Trimmel tossed the response aside and shifted his attention toward Queen Chrysalis. "So, my Queen? What do you think?"\n\n"I think it's the excuse we've wanted," Chrysalis said, rubbing her hooves together. "If the deer think that firm words will be all it takes to save them, they will be disappointed. One way or another, they will fall, and I can't wait to see the look on [OLE.GetLeader]'s face when it all comes crashing down on their pathetic excuse for a nation.""
changelings.5.a:0 "The deer will kneel to us, whether they want to do it covered in their own blood or not."

changelings.6.t:0 "Olenia Yields To Our Might"
changelings.6.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis scoffed as she read the response from [OLE.GetLeader] to her demands that the entire country submit to the might of the Changeling Hives. "It was that easy? Pathetic," she said, rolling her eyes and passing the response back to an aide to file away safely. "I guess the deer really are frightened prey. I suppose it's a good thing for them we'll be set to look out for them... so long as they give us the love we deserve." She giggled to herself and sat upright on her throne. "Well, fortunately for the deer, the Heer won't get to try out our new toys on them. Those, we'll save for Equestria. The Olenians can rest assured that they have the might of our armies to protect them from Equestrian influence. We will truly be the kindest and most benevolent guardians of the deer we could be, because if any of them say otherwise, they won't be around long enough to say much else." She rubbed her hooves together. "The first domino has fallen...""
changelings.6.a:0 "Onwards to Equestria!"

changelings.7.t:0 "Olenia Refuses To Yield"
changelings.7.d:0 ""The deer have rejected our offer to surrender, my Queen," Queen's Guard captain Dieter Heinrich said, tossing the Olenian response on the ground before Queen Chrysalis' throne. "And rather rudely, too. They used language that I never thought a non-soldier could know. But, it is just as you expected. The deer are too proud to bow."\n\n"Good," Chrysalis said. "I've been waiting for the opportunity to try out our reorganized Heer. The deer have given me just the excuse to send in the tanks and make some noise. Mobilize the armies. They'll fall before us in moments, crushed under our superior might, and the Olenians will realize what a mistake it was to stand up to us... not that it will save them from what they deserve in the slightest.""
changelings.7.a:0 "They want to do this the hard way? I want to do it the hard way too!"

changelings.8.t:0 "Olenia Surrenders"
changelings.8.d:0 ""Cowards, the lot of them," Hivesmarschall Trimmel said, shaking his head. "I barely started my tanks before the Olenians folded. My Panzers still have half-full tanks of gasoline. The Olenians must be issued white flags with their soldiery kits, because I've never seen so many fly so quickly. I almost shot at them out of frustration. Almost."\n\nQueen Chrysalis frowned down at her Hivesmarschall, though her ire was not for him. "Were they trying to call a bluff? Did [OLE.GetLeader] really not think we would dare to invade Olenia if they refused? How laughable." She shook her head and waved her hoof to dismiss Trimmel. "Very well, if they won't put up a fight, then we have nothing to gain by slaughtering them save for another enemy. The equipment and bugpower we saved from the Olenians surrendering would be best used against Equestria. They will be the real tough nut to crack, and so we must throw everything we have against them. That's where the real fight lies.""
changelings.8.a:0 "Olenia... all that chest pounding and for what? Dead deer?"

changelings.10.t:0 "War With [VAN.GetName]."
changelings.10.d:0 "A fractured Equestria is a weak Equestria, that much is certain. The current situation in the aftermath of the War of the Two Sisters is very favorable to us as we seek to end this Equestrian blight once and for all. While Equestria struggles to put back together the pieces from its catastrophic civil war, we will be sure to take advantage of the chaos and confusion. The city of Vanhoover is one of Equestria's most important naval ports, and not only that, a significant population of changelings lives in and around the city. It's time that we welcome our brothers and sisters back into the fold with open forelegs, and while we're at it, seize the all-important Equestria dockyards in Luna Bay. Not only will these dockyards be put to better use producing ships for our navy, but it will widen the border against Equestria, giving us an opportunity to outflank the Equestrian left and crush their army before the war has even truly begun. We will need every advantage fighting the Equestrian beast, and picking off one of its strongest city-states will benefit us greatly."
changelings.10.a:0 "Vanhoover will fall, and that'll really give Equestria something to worry about."

changelings.11.t:0 "War With [SCS.GetName]."
changelings.11.d:0 ""A fractured Equestria is a weak Equestria, that much is certain. The current situation in the aftermath of the War of the Two Sisters is very favorable to us as we seek to end this Equestrian blight once and for all. While Equestria struggles to put back together the pieces from its catastrophic civil war, we will be sure to take advantage of the chaos and confusion. The foolish [SCS.GetName] have split off from Equestria. Their supplies of crude oil have made them powerful in their own right, but only a valuable prize for us. Seizing their oil supplies will allow us to run our Panzers for longer than we otherwise could have.  We must take control of this oil and grant our army the freedom to drive as far as it can. Yet another piece of Equestria is ready to fall into our hooves!"
changelings.11.a:0 "Their oil shall be ours!"

changelings.12.t:0 "War With [From.GetName]."
changelings.12.d:0 ""A fractured Equestria is a weak Equestria, that much is certain. The current situation in the aftermath of the War of the Two Sisters is very favorable to us as we seek to end this Equestrian blight once and for all. While Equestria struggles to put back together the pieces from its catastrophic civil war, we will be sure to take advantage of the chaos and confusion. The foolish [From.GetName] have split off from Equestria. The fractured state of our greatest enemy shall make them all the easier to conquer. Piece by piece we shall devour Equestria until there is nothing left to conquer. Divided they shall fall to our might!"
changelings.12.a:0 "To war!"

changelings.14.t:0 "War With [STG.GetName]."
changelings.14.d:0 "[STG.GetName] stands in the way of the ambitions of our Glorious Queen. Not only are they ponies that we must conquer, but they are the home of that disgusting ideology called Communism, which stands in direct opposition to the natural hierarchy of the hives and the changeling species. Letting this state fester in continued existence could only be a disaster. They must be crushed immediately, and we shall make them submit by any means necessary!"
changelings.14.a:0 "To war!"

changelings.16.t:0 "Espionage in Equestria"
changelings.16.d:0 "Vaspier Orn Kladisium paced around his desk, a lit cigarette hanging from his lips. Held in his magic before him were several plain folders, which he opened and looked through one after the other. Early feelers from the first wave of infiltrators sent into the country had identified several weaknesses within the Equestrian state, ranging from things as simple as factory overseers to levels all the way up to the highest order of government. Though the Equestrians were wary of changeling infiltration owing to the world situation and the failed invasion of Canterlot in 1002, they had yet to close off any ways for VOPS to get a hoof inside of the nation. That would be their undoing.\n\nVaspier set the folders aside and pulled up his roster of agents on standby. The greatest strength of the changeling race was their ability to shapeshift into almost any form, but the average changeling had limits to that ability. Without training, a form could only be assumed for so long, and the impersonation could be imperfect. Those familiar with the individual being impersonated would soon sniff out the falsehood standing before them. But the infiltrators of the VOPS were the best of the best, each extensively trained to perfectly impersonate a target, relentlessly drilled for weeks on every detail and habit of their assumed likeness. These infiltrators, Vaspier would release en masse into Equestria. With perfectly placed spies throughout the Equestrian Army, the resulting chaos and confusion would soon make it impossible for them to resist the swarm.\n\nVaspier let his cigarette burn out, then squashed it in an ashtray. Soon, Equestria, just like that cigarette, would be snuffed out."
changelings.16.a:0 "The Equestrians won't know who to trust when VOPS is through with them."

changelings.17.t:0 "[EQS.GetName] Has Destroyed Our Spy Network!"
changelings.17.d:0 "The Great Imperial Nobody sat at his desk, reviewing the reports coming in from his spies, or at least, the ones that could send reports. The infiltration had worked for a time, and it had worked wonderfully. Noling could deny that. But eventually, the Equestrians developed their own means of detecting changelings, and ever since then, Vaspier had watched as his spy network began to disintegrate. He'd lost two score infiltrators to Equestrian counterespionage, and it wasn't long after that that he had to give the order to stand down and cease operations. Infiltrators were expensive to train, and it took months to complete their training; they were too valuable a resource to squander fruitlessly. Those that could, he'd instructed to continue small-scale espionage and report back any findings he came across, while others he instructed to go to ground or return to changeling lines. Maybe in the future, VOPS would be able to mount another massive infiltration operation, but for now, the Hives would have to be satisfied with what VOPS had managed to accomplish. He only hoped those brutes in the Heer hadn't squandered all the hard work that had gone into gathering intel and exploiting Equestrian weaknesses."
changelings.17.a:0 "Many infiltrators died to bring us this information."

changelings.18.t:0 "Sombra Demands Our Subjugation"
changelings.18.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis watched with raised eyebrows as the ambassador from the Crystal Empire approached her throne. She had heard the news of King Sombra's return, and as far as she was concerned, that was a good sign. Anything that weakened Equestria and its allies was good for her. "You stand in the presence of Her Royal Majesty, Great Queen Chrysalis, first of her name," Chrysalis' herald called out. "Bow your head before the queen of all the changelings and state your business."\n\nTo Chrysalis' surprise, the ambassador refused to do so, and instead cleared his throat. "Queen Chrysalis, I come bearing an ultimatum from His Imperial Majesty, King Sombra, King of Kings and Emperor of Emperors. Now that the long-awaited king has finally returned to his throne, it is only right that this continent gives him the respect he deserves. It is the King's command that you bow before him and pledge fealty as a steadfast subject, and in exchange, His Imperial Majesty offers you and your nation his eternal protection."\n\nEvery changeling in the room bristled at the bold demands, and none more so than Chrysalis herself. "Me? Pledge loyalty to a ghost?!" She snarled at the ambassador. "The Queen of the Changelings bows to nobody, least of all a pony!"\n\n"If you do not kneel before His Imperial Majesty, then he will respond with military force, and your pathetic nation will be crushed before his armies, like so many others before you. It is your choice whether you would embrace his friendship, or suffer his wrath.""
changelings.18.a:0 "The only thing Sombra will be getting from the changelings is your body stuffed in a box!"
changelings.18.b:0 "We do not wish to come to blows with King Sombra. We will yield to his rule."

changelings.19.t:0 "Sombra Offers An Alliance!"
changelings.19.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis watched with raised eyebrows as the ambassador from the Crystal Empire approached her throne. She had heard the news of King Sombra's return, and as far as she was concerned, that was a good sign. Anything that weakened Equestria and its allies was good for her. "You stand in the presence of Her Royal Majesty, Great Queen Chrysalis, first of her name," Chrysalis' herald called out. "Bow your head before the queen of all the changelings and state your business."\n\nThe ambassador respectfully dipped his head. It wasn't a full bow, but it was good enough for relations between two monarchies. "His Imperial Majesty, King Sombra, King of Kings and Emperor of Emperors, wishes to extend his hoof in an offer of friendship to the Great Queen Chrysalis of the Changeling Hives," the ambassador said. "It is in the benefits of both of our nations to forge an alliance and work in unison to see the destruction of Equestria. Our armies, working together as one, can enslave this continent beneath us. The king eagerly awaits your reply."\n\nChrysalis rubbed her hoof against her chin. An alliance with Sombra? She immediately wanted to reject on the basis that Sombra was little more than a pony, but he was more than that, wasn't he? He had powers that made him more than the average equine, and his military prowess was certainly formidable. Perhaps an alliance would be in the best interest of the Changeling Hives..."
changelings.19.a:0 "Sombra is a pony, and all ponies deserve nothing more than to be subjects of the Changeling Hives!."
changelings.19.b:0 "An alliance will work splendidly! Let us work together to toss Celestia off of her shiny mountain and kick her into the sea!"

changelings.20.t:0 "Peace Has Failed!"
changelings.20.d:0 ""And so it is clear that there is no choice but to have war! Not just war, but a war that swallows the whole nation, and then the world!" Queen Chrysalis stood at the head of Marble Field in front of 30,00 soldiers. She had been giving a grandiose speech for the last… however long. All she knew was that doing this at night sucked, doing it with all the searchlights arranged around the field to make a grand set of light walls made it worth it, and she was nearing the end.\n"I know that you all wish to cleave, remove, square off against, burn, cleanse, battle, attack, and smash the ponies by the hundreds with vicious abandon. You do not even need to ask! Our great revenge will see us trampling over their retreating forms as we rush ever onwards towards the final victory! We do not want peace, and neither should they! They will understand the peace they have earned when we prove that we can erect a new hive built out of their dead!"\nThe floodgates broke. There were scattered screams in the crowd that, in a frightening display of discipline, harmonized into one single, all-encompassing, ground-shaking, body-felt chant: "Sieg heil! Sieg heil!" as the mass thrust its limbs into the air in perfect salutes. \nFrom atop her podium, Chrysalis had some fear in the back of her mind. Fanaticism like this was hard to control, and control it she would have to after victory. But from where she was standing, basking in the glow of her army's perfect adoration and sublime oneness, feeling their rage echo throughout her form, she could only think of one thing..."
changelings.20.a:0 "It's a great feeling!"

changelings.21.t:0 "Lovely Shadows"
changelings.21.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis sighed as she sifted through the stack of papers requiring her attention. This was the part of monarchy she hated: paperwork. No matter what she did, no matter how she tried to escape it, it always found a way to torment her. Perhaps the grunts in her armies had it the best; she much rather would have been fighting in the trenches than scribbling her signature over and over again behind a desk.\n\nAs she shifted a stack of papers, however, a simple envelope fell out. Quirking a brow, Chrysalis picked up the letter and deftly ripped it open with her magic. Inside was a hoofwritten note from King Sombra, and Chrysalis blinked in surprise as she read it over:\n\n"Fairest Queen of the Changeling Hives, I have long had my eye on you. As you surely know, the continuation of a monarchy requires the production of an heir, and only a king is fit to marry a queen of your stature. And you, Chrysalis, are finer than the finest of crystals. Let us bind our two nations together in more ways than one; let us bind them together just as we bind ourselves together as husband and wife. I eagerly await your response.\nSombra"\n\nChrysalis blinked, a fluster beginning to build in her cheeks. Her eyes darted between the letter, the wastebasket, and the pen sitting on her desk. What did she do? Did she toss his letter away and ignore it... or should she instead write a reply?"
changelings.21.a:0 "I never thought I'd settle down and get married, but there's a first for everything."
changelings.21.b:0 "I'm going to pretend I never got this letter and hope that's the end of it."

Rather than fighting a sustained guerilla war that would only end in their death, they have offered to surrender to us, in exchange for our protection.

changelings.32.d:0 "The radios were alive with covert transmissions from Vaspier's spies. VOPS infiltrators, together with changeling Jaegers, had successfully managed to infiltrate the Equestrian lines. Now, after weeks of preparations and clandestine weapons drops behind the Equestrian army, the infiltrators were ready to strike. Just minutes ago, Vaspier read the confirmation that the saboteurs were ready to strike. And with the Heer already squaring off against the ponies, there was no time like the present. Folding up the report, Vaspier picked up the phone receiver on his desk and spun the dial. He waited until he heard the click of the phone being connected to its destination. "Zero hour is a go," he said into the receiver, and he set it back down. Within seconds, he knew the saboteurs would be moving out to their assignments. All he had to do now was sit back and wait for confirmation of their success."

changelings.36.d:0 "Building ships is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. Unlike a rifle which can be assembled by a single drone, or a tank which is neatly fabricated and welded together by a few changelings in a factory, a ship is practically a town floating on the sea. It takes the efforts of countless dockyards and factories working together to assemble the ship, piece by piece, over weeks of hard work. Ditrysium is the largest of our dockyards and our greatest port, and even it is struggling to keep up with the demands of our navies. Queen Helvia has petitioned Queen Chrysalis for more funding and resources to expand the dockyards and supply the navy with the ships it desperately needs. Unfortunately, the resources we can set aside for Ditrysium cannot do both. We can either expand the dockyards to gain more ships in the long run, or dedicate the resources that could be used to construct those dockyards to instead bolster the construction of our ships, giving us more in the short term. What shall we tell Queen Helvia?"

We have a certain amount of funding set aside that we could dedicate to improved military production, and Queen Argynnis will certainly see this money. We, however, have a say in how she uses it. Shall we order the queen to focus on long term investments and use the money to build more factories, or should she focus on the short term and focus on increasing production for as long as the money lasts?"

It is hoped that these conditions, among others, will prevent another war from ever occurring. However, even now there are those in Canterlot itself who say that this peace treaty will only be remembered the prelude to an even grander and more deadly conflict."

In the letter he claims that the Changelings and all other creatures living in the northern land could be a great asset to Equestria in their war if they were finally given an independent military organization again. The letter was met by mixed feelings by the general staff. Some claim that giving the Changelings their own command is just asking for the horrors of the Great War to repeat themselves, but this time on a second front. Others say that the general staff is already overworked managing all of Equestria's divisions, armies, army groups, and theaters, and that [From.GetNameDef] taking over some of the load would be a good help."

changelingattache.1.d:0 "'Because of internal matters within the Changeling Lands the scientists, soldiers, advisors, and all related personnel of the Changeling-Griffonian Expeditionary Mission are hereby ordered to return home at once by the decree of Queen Chrysalis.'\nThe message is simple, written in a taciturn dialect of the language the two distant nations share, yet profound in its meaning. For years the changelings assisting the Imperial Army and attached research divisions have become a staple of life for those in the upper echelons of the command hierarchy, and now it is time for them to leave. The mood is unsurprisingly somber when the message is read aloud, both for what leaving means and for what awaits the changelings in their homeland.\nSynovial, senior military commander of the mission, seems relieved at the news, as if a great weight had been lifted off his wings. His compatriot, Thranx, seems to have had the opposite reaction, falling into a depressive stupor that in turn lowers the mood of all those near him. The differing reactions have prompted one of the Imperial commanders who worked with the CGEM to voice the idea that they should throw a party for all the members of the mission to wish them fond farewells, for it would seem to be kind to let their last memories of the Griffonian Empire be happy ones."

A noblegriff actually managed to impersonate a changeling colonel, and soldiers of both species broke out into song over large flaggons of beer. Fun was had by all, and somecreature was even able to get Thranx to smile again.\n\nDuring the party though it seems that [GRI.GetLeader] overheard Imperial Army soldiers wishing their Changeling friends that they could help them out or even fight alongside them in whatever struggle awaited them back home. This would lead to a review of supplies and troop strength in the morrow. Theoretically, the proposal could be done, but it also could just be written off as an alcohol-induced hallucination.\n\nIn any case, this night will long be remembered as the rowdiest party in memory, and a true bright spot on the record of Imperial affairs."

Their 'empire' had already been torn apart by their own minions, and their decadence and incompetence even today does not cease to amaze me. If they so valiantly refuse my orders and demands, then they must be entirely unaware of who they've just made an enemy with. Their sorry little Empire will collapse like a house of cards, and I will tear it apart and burn it and its citizens to ashes myself if I have to!

changelingattache.10.t:0 "Revenge of the Queen"
changelingattache.10.d:0 "It all appeared to be a perfectly normal day, today. For the most part.\nGeneral Thranx had used the time in Griffonia and away from other changelings to better incorporate himself into the life of a griffon. Often times he had used his shapeshifting abilities to 'fit in', but many griffons, especially those who had previously worked with him, respected and liked him either way, no matter the appearance.\nThranx has even gone so far as finding a lover that lived just outside of the capital. It was all too perfect, it seemed, and the lone Changeling appeared to be in good claws.\nThat was nothing but a ruse though, it seems. Earlier today, during a visit at a restaurant, Thranx began to cough heavily, and shortly after collapsed to the ground. Griffons nearby immediately rushed to his rescue, seeing him cough up blood, but it was no use. General Thranx... died.\nA funeral has already been organised for this brave changeling, and he has been issued  griffonian citizenship post-mortem to thank him for the appreciation he shared for our nation and culture.\nShockingly though, police has found out that the cause of Thranx death was a deadly poison, one that has never been seen or used in all of Griffonia before. In addition, his fiancée is nowhere to be found following his death. Could this be the work of a fellow changeling, sent by Chrysalis? For now, we are unsure."

Before she could reply though, Trimmel publicly thanked the volunteers and assigned them positions in the Army. Chrysalis is furious at this, and said that if harmony grows it will be Trimmel's fault, but otherwise made no moves against it."

changelingattache.14.d:0 "Evening had fallen over Griffenheim, the gas lamps of the city lightning up the streets as the last few shops closed up for the day. Two changelings in full military uniform sat at a café, slowly sipped a cup of coffee each, taking in the majesty of the city, looking out on the plaza besides them. It had been a long time since they had arrived in the city, but nonetheless, their usual place, the Café Central always provided the best coffee and view. At least one a lot better than anything you could get in Vesalipolis. \nOne of the changelings, eyes a bright blue began talking as he lit up a cigarette "Been a long time since we heard from Her Majesty. From what Der Bürger says, the war must be going badly, Synoval"\n"Thranx, I trust that these are merely some kind of propaganda from the Ponies. Before long, we will be invited to gala in Canterlot," Synoval answered, pouring a spoonful of sugar into the coffee, before stirring it around.\nThranx took another sip of his coffee"I don't know really. The telegraph speaks of the same. Bombardment on Vesalipolis, pushed back from Hjortland. If anything, I would suspect the Palace of keeping us in the dark."\n"Think so? You really think they would keep us in the dark?" Synoval deadpanned.\n"Yes. We are only here on a voluntary basis because of the war back home," Thranx said as he pulsed on the cigarette, enjoying the goods available in the Empire.\n"And yet, if we wanted to go home, we could just grab the first postal plane out of here. It's not like they will take offense," Synoval said, not noticing the waiter coming up behind them.\n"Sirs? There's a person on the phone for you. It's from the Changeling Embassy. They say it's urgent," He said, pointing with his left claw towards the bar.\nSynoval and Thranx rose from the table. "It seems like our duty calls," Thranx sighed as he put a few coins on the table, walking up to the phone on the bar with Synoval in tow. He picked up the reciever and listened closely.\nThe tired and frantic voice in the reciever stammered out a few words before hanging up "Vesalipolis fallen...total collapse...all officers recalled to the homeland to fight against the Equestrian menace."\nThranx dropped the reciever, looking towards Synoval, with a blank look.\n"Well, what did they say?" Synoval asked, probably somewhat cognizant of the message Thranx had just recieved.\nThranx muttered as the words replayed in his head. "The homeland has fallen. We must journey back to do our duty against the Equestrians."\nWith that, the Changeling presence in the Empire left, ready to travel home to fight on the fronts once more."
changelingattache.14.d_annex:0 "The front pages of newspapers across Griffonia all bore the same headline today, "Changelings issue unconditional surrender, peace in Equestria".\nThe Changeling embassy in Griffenheim confirmed the news, before admitting that their contact with the homeland was now completely cut off. With the Changeling military disintegrating and the future of the entire country up in the air, the question of what to do with the Changeling military mission within the Empire has presented itself. They are now Changelings with no nation, serving under a command that no longer exists.\nThe Changelings of the Expedition have adapted well to Griffonia, with many having absorbed Griffonian customs over the many years they have been present in Griffenheim. Granting them Griffonian citizenship and letting them stay would certainly be an option. Their expertise in warfare has been invaluable in modernizing our military. Thranx, in particular, has made it very clear that he would prefer things to continue as they had before.\nAlternatively, we could simply send them on their way, leaving them whatever fate has in store for them. Whatever our decision, there is no need to worry about attracting the ire of Chrysalis anymore."

They are weak and small, and as such, they should naturally fear us, the strongest nation in the region.\n\nYet diplomacy does not need to fail immediately. What the bears lack in industry, they make up for in other ways. The gold reserves of the bears would go a long way toward strengthening our economy, freeing up funds that could be used elsewhere. Alternatively, the bears have deposits of steel that could be useful in bolstering our military production, should we gain access to them. On top of that, we could seize the bordering states with the bears, putting them under our direct control, giving us access to the industry and citizens inside of these lands.

changelings.47.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader] The imperialistic Changeling policy has taken another victim, those being the secluded Polar Bear Communities in the frozen north. While the Bears have been mostly isolated from world politics at large, that changed with the arrival of a changeling envoy, who demanded various concessions for their Queen. [PLB.GetLeader] rejected all of these demands as outlandish, saying that the bears would never bow before brutes and bullies, and if the changelings wanted those concessions so badly, they would have to come and take them.\n\nNaturally, a response from Chrysalis didn't take long, and changeling troops crossed the border in a full scale invasion. Bear defences quickly collapsed, and an armistice was signed the following day. With most of the bears retreating to safer lands, a new government was installed under the leadership of a bear known as Björnling, who is, by all accounts, known to be a fascist sympathiser."

While the Bears have been mostly isolated from world politics at large, that changed with the arrival of a changeling envoy, who demanded various concessions for their Queen. While [PLB.GetLeader] has agreed to some of these demands, it was deemed insufficient by the emissary, and the changeling envoy returned unsatisfied with the partial terms. However, the bears of the north held their breath and prayed that the concessions they gave the Changeling Hives would be enough.\n\nIt seemed as if nothing would come out of this, but a week later, a series of raids and skirmishes began on the Changeling-Bear border, resulting in the devastation of numerous bear villages and many civilian casualties. The bear leadership, knowing that this could escalate into a full scale invasion, have agreed to the initial changeling demands, wishing to preserve their independence."

While the Bears have been mostly isolated from world politics at large, that changed with the arrival of a changeling envoy, who demanded various concessions for their Queen. Knowing that resistance is futile, [PLB.GetLeader] agreed to all of the changelings' demands in exchange for their protection and payment.\n\nThe Queen was very pleased with this outcome, and a tight alliance was established, binding the bears to the Changeling Hegemony in exchange for Changeling military protection. Much of the bears' iron and gold reserves have been moved out of the country towards Vesalipolis, fuelling the future changeling war effort. Their citizens are dissatisfied to have bent over before the changelings' demands, but are more grateful to have kept a small measure of their independence and lives."
changelings.47.a:0 "Worrying."
changelings.47.b:0 "Great."

changelings.48.t:0 "Attack Successful!"
changelings.48.d:0 "Our limited engagement with the polar bear forces along the border has resulted in a decisive victory for our troops. The bears put up a stiff resistance at first, but as the artillery thundered and our troops swarmed into their lines, their lines of defense swiftly collapsed, allowing us to take full control of the area. We are now consolidating our gains and awaiting further development of the situation."
changelings.48.a:0 "Excellent."

changelings.49.t:0 "Attack was repelled"
changelings.49.d:0 "Our limited engagement with the polar bear forces along the border has resulted in a stunning defeat for our troops. In our attempts to limit the conflict from exploding into all-out war, we committed only a fraction of our army, and it seems that was not enough. With strong defensive positions, the bears managed to resist our attack, and our forces were soon in disarray and scattered by an ursine counterattack. All we have gained from this struggle is humiliation and a heaping helping of changeling dead."
changelings.49.a:0 "The Royal Changeling Heer losing to some bears?"
changelings.49.b:0 "Move to the second stage!"

changelings.50.t:0 "Border incident ended with nothing"
changelings.50.d:0 "It would seem our border assault has ended in a stalemate, as both us and the bears are unable to truly claim victory. This is unexpected, and almost inconceivable. How did our superior army fail to score a decisive victory against the bears?"
changelings.50.a:0 "The bears stopped us?"

changelings.51.t:0 "Mighty Bear Army Wins Again!"
changelings.51.d:0 "We have sent them packing! Our territory and land are safe from their clutches once again! How many more times they will try to destroy us, who can say, but all the world knows that our glorious army has once more saved us from certain doom!"
changelings.51.a:0 "Yes!"

changelings.52.t:0 "The Changelings Beat Us!"
changelings.52.d:0 "Disaster! Our forces have been totally routed, and we have lost the state entirely! There is little to do but fall back and do what we can to at least save what's left of our country and heritage!"
changelings.52.a:0 "Retreat!"

changelings.53.t:0 "Attack Repelled!"
changelings.53.d:0 "The Changelings came at us, and we sent them back! Despite the seemingly overwhelming statue of their military, we've sent the bugs fleeing from our land! What the bugs thought would be an easy war has turned into a costly disaster for their army, and this is a defeat they will not soon forget. This is our land, and today, the Changelings have learnt we won't give it up without a fight!"
changelings.53.a:0 "Yarr!"

changelings.54.t:0 "Negotiations Table"
changelings.54.d_gold:0 "As described by our terms, we will take a sum of your gold in exchange for our protection, forming a protectorate under our control."

changelings.54.a:0 "The Queen always gets what she wants!"
changelings.54.b:0 "Our Queen cannot be stopped!"
changelings.54.c:0 "The Bears will love their new Queen."
changelings.54.e:0 "Our Queen is the best ruler one could ever wish for."

changelings.55.t:0 "The Bears Resist!"
changelings.55.d:0 "Impossibly, it appears that direct force will not work against the bears on their home turf. The terrain is too favorable for the defenders, and they know it well, thwarting our obviously superior army and forces. However, we are changelings, and we have more than direct force available. If we cannot take them in open war, then we shall wreak havoc on their nation from within with a veritable army of infiltrators. Soon, they shall be unable to trust each other, and the chaos we can impart on their small and weak nation with just a small amount of infiltrators shall mean further resistance will prove impossible."
changelings.55.a:0 "Send the Infiltrator Army."

changelings.56.t:0 "Changeling Infiltrators in Our Land"
changelings.56.d:0 "Changelings have infilitrated our nation in response to our resistance! They are interfering with our nation, causing chaos and panic across our nation. Nobody knows who they can trust, and even the mere suggestion that somebody may be an infiltrator is enough to have their friends and even family turn against them. With our nation in this much chaos, how much longer can we hope to resist the hives?"
changelings.56.a:0 "We must surrender to them!"
changelings.56.b:0 "We fight!"

changelings.57.t:0 "Changelings honour the Deal"
changelings.57.d:0 "The changelings have kept their word! Not only have we officially gained their protection, but with that status comes a number of benefits; such as their researchers and construction workers coming to help bring us up to their level!"
changelings.57.a:0 "Maybe it's actually more beneficial for us..."

changelings.58.t:0 "Time to Act!"
changelings.58.d:0 "The changelings are losing! What is their protection worth if they cannot even protect themselves? We have an opportunity to betray them and secure ourselves a place on the winning side! Do we take it?"
changelings.58.a:0 "Attack!"
changelings.58.b:0 "We will honour our agreement!"

changelings.59.t:0 "Countrywide Raids"
changelings.59.d:0 "The Secret Police of Vesalipolis, Ditrysium, Volistad, Lyctida, Sicarus, Phantine and every other Changeling hive worth mentioning have begun an operation to pull out the Harmonic foreign influence by the hair. After months of infiltration and information-gathering, the fruit was borne in scalding gas and machine gun screeches. From dusk until dawn, the whole of the nation echoed with the screams of modern staffs of death, as a political reunion took place with the sole aim to wipe the Thoraxians out of reality. Hive police, military police, Imperial police, and the Queen's Guard kicked in door after door, exterminating any who resisted and hanging the survivors from Queen Chrysalis's newly-built lamp-posts. The Heer stalked the fields, flushing them from their caves and hideouts with flamethrowers, grenades, and tanks, in order to massacre the rabble as they fled. Hundreds of our officers fell, but the enemy was butchered by the tens of thousands. Through methods doubtless beyond the understanding of the common citizen, the Prandialists joined in the purge before declaring support for the Queen, and even the Black Generation closed its doors to fleeing Thoraxians.\n\nAs the sun rose the next morning, there was much work to be done. The dead leaders had their remains paraded through town to cheering crowds to the site of the public execution of those still living. The remains of bodies of ponies who had helped out the Thoraxians were categorized and determined to be nearly all Stalliongradian, and the report was summarily buried in favor of calling them Equestrians. The rest were donated to the poorhouses and shelters of the nation, so that they could at least give something back as a corpse.\n\nDisappointingly, the arch-traitor kept the best escape routes for himself, and fled with his remaining benefactors to parts unknown as one of the few survivors."
changelings.59.a:0 "There is an axe with his name on it!"

changelings.61.t:0 "Grand Military Parade In Vesalipolis"
changelings.61.d:0 "Today the streets of the hive-city of Vesalipolis were filled to the brim with changelings, with many buzzing above in the air. They had all gathered to spectate a huge military parade, which had been prepared and advertised for weeks. Changelings had come from all across the nation, and even the other four Hive Queens were present. It was, apart from Queen Chrysalis' coronation as Great Queen of the Changeling Hegemony, the largest parade the city had ever seen.\n\nIn the square, columns of changeling soldiers dressed in grey soon emerged out of their barracks, marching with synchronized steps and waving their white banners. As they marched, the civilians greeted them with cheers and admired their discipline. Behind them, shiny new Panzers rolled out, with Hivesmarschall Trimmel leading the long column of a hundred tanks. They were followed by motorized divisions in their trucks, artillery battalions with their wheeled guns, marines, sailors, elite Jaeger squadrons, Queen's Guard, and more. It was an endless stream of soldiers armed to the brim with the newest weaponry. The audience was left in awe and convinced of the might of their nation, their belief in the salvation Queen Chrysalis promised them stronger than ever.\n\nAt the end of the column came Chrysalis herself, riding in an officer's car and dressed in a snow-white military uniform. She saluted the crowd and the crowd saluted her, chanting "Long live the Queen!" almost fanatically. And as she rode, roaring fighters and bombers appeared in the sky and blotted out the sun.\n\nThis was just the beginning. Soon, the soldiers and their weapons of war would be turned toward all of the Hegemony's enemies, and one by one, those nations would fall and become nothing more than sources of love for the changeling species."
changelings.61.a:0 "Glory to the Changeling Queendom!"

changelings.63.t:0 "The Hunt for Thorax"
changelings.63.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis stormed into VOPS headquarters in the foulest mood she had been in in a very, very long time. She did not even look at the masses of changeling pencil-pushers that made up the main body of the organization, knowing full well that her only goal was to get to Vaspier Orn Kladisium, the most important nobody in the country. She knocked on the door to his unassuming office, then magically bashed it in.\nVaspier was staring at her with rapt attention. He already knew what this was about, and his perpetual fake smile was heavy on his face for it. "We already have most of our resources aimed at the arch-traitor, my Queen", he said to cut her off. It was a futile gesture.\n"Damn right you do! Now explain why his head isn't on my desk already, you dumpster-diving buffoon!" The Queen shouted back with the fury of a thousand hives.\nVaspier took the slightest pause. He knew the answer, and that it was entirely his fault. "...He was tipped off. By someone in this organization."\n"Really? There were Thoraxian harmonists in this organization? The one tasked with FINDING AND EXTERMINATING EVERY LAST TRAITOROUS HARMONIST IN THIS NATION? It's a good thing it's only the secret police that have been corrupted! At least you know better than dumping Thoraxian assassins in my bedchamber!" She took a second to breathe. The anger was making it hard for her to talk properly. \nVaspier spoke up. "There's a limited number of places he could go. We have the bulk of our agents moving to try and head him off. We'll get him, you have my word. Speaking of which, have you thought of the perfect method yet?" Vaspier smiled hard back, changing the subject. He knew the answer from her face, but he wanted to know the exact method.\n"Indeed. If he wants to be a pony so much, then I don't think he needs that carapace. And Dieter can work miracles with the right knives… wouldn't that be a fun spectation?" At the thought of that, Vaspier's smile turned real for a brief second."
changelings.63.a:0 "As you say, Your Majesty."

changelings.64.t:0 "Stage Magic"
changelings.64.d:0 "Recently, a Changeling refugee by the name of Thorax entered our protective custody. He was the leader of the last major rebel movement within the Changeling Lands, and was forced to flee during the purge of said movement, which was reportedly quite violent. He escaped with the help of "foreign backers", and through the sacrifice of a body double, and has now come here to ask us to show his remaining followers that he is still alive, and possibly to influence his home nation directly.\nNormally, we would deny this request flat-out. Supporting rebels in this way has been a big no-go ever since the Prandial Wars, where our support only spread the problem around rather than turn it into a solution. However, the Changeling state has attempted to use that body double to try and trick everyone into thinking that Thorax is dead entirely. Showing that he is alive now can throw a colossal wrench into their plans, and do serious damage to the credibility of the regime, which currently hates us.\nThe downside is that, as mentioned, the regime already hates us, and as they killed his body double by tearing off his carapace and broadcasting his screams live, they hate Thorax even more. If we reveal that Thorax is alive and in our custody, they will not take it well.\nBut there's another dimension: Thorax is a Harmonist, and seems to be a real one this time. So are his remaining followers. It is our goal to try and spread Harmony throughout the world, and here is one case where it has spread itself, and we have the option to keep it from being snuffed out as a sapling."
changelings.64.a:0 "We must help a friend in need."
changelings.64.b:0 "We won't risk our ponies in their internal politics!"

changelings.65.t:0 ""It's not him""
changelings.65.d:0 ""What do you mean it's not him?" Queen Chrysalis asked. She had seen him get dragged down here, and it very clearly was Thorax. The VOPS officers who bravely pulled him from his entourage just before he escaped to the Crystal City's inner sphere, they said it was him.\n"I mean, it's not him. It's a body double. I don't know why his foreign masters thought it was a good idea to do that for a changeling, but we've walked right into it." Dieter finished cleaning the blood off of his knife and put it on the nearby cart.\n Chrysalis was furious. "This is a disaster! How am I going to get my spectation now?"\nDieter remained cool, or at least not unusually miserable. "Well, if he's close enough to fool us until we put him under torture, he's probably close enough to fool the cameras. Hence, why this normally isn't done. I say we execute him as Thorax anyways."\n There was a pause as Chrysalis tried to wrap her brain around that. "Wha... but... wait, that WORKS?" It was a brutally direct solution, but seemed foolproof.\n"Probably. Since the real one was headed to the Crystal Empire, he's probably in Equestria right now, and they should know better than to admit to harboring a terrorist leader. If they do, we just pretend that they're the ones lying, since they definitely won't give him over for proof... Oh, and while you're here, the VOPS auditing team is ready."\nThe queen thought about the question. That was an oddly charitable interpretation of Equestria's relations with the state, but if it did indeed work out that way..."
changelings.65.a:0 "The nation wants blood, and frankly, so do I."
changelings.65.b:0 "Equestria has been getting more antagonistic recently. Just focus on VOPS."

changelings.66.t:0 "Enjoy the Show"
changelings.66.d:0 "Bound and gagged, "Thorax" was marched onto the stage and chained to an upright pole. In attendance were Her Majesty Queen Chrysalis, Captain of the Queen's Guard and Vhy Dieter Heinrich, and somewhere in the audience, Vaspier orn Kladisium, representing everyone who knew the trick. Also in attendance was Hivesmarschall Trimmel, the accused's brother General Pharynx, numerous other officers and leaders, and thousands of audience members. A large radio set ensured that all would be transmitted across the nation to countless homes.\n"Thorax," Chrysalis called down from her seat. "You have brought shame and instability to this nation through your treason to the Equine race. On my name as Queen, I decree that the sentence is spectation, to be carried out by Captain Dieter Heinrich."\nThe good captain stepped down from his podium to where the imposter was restrained. He recieved a set of knives from a nearby officer, picked one out, and sighed. Torture and public appearances were things he was good at, but didn't like, and this was both. He placed the tip of the knife between the read thigh plate and the ventral plate, and...\n\nExactly one hour later, "Thorax" was declared dead, much of his carapace and all of his blood on the ground around him. As promised, not even then was there the burst of fire of a changeling transforming into their true form.\nIn the days to follow, the Harmonists in the nation who had survived by not ever speaking up would think that this was appalling, and they would once again say nothing. Most would find it merely "a bit much". The changelings who the state news talked about were the ones who loved it."
changelings.66.a:0 "The Queen was one of those."

changelings.67.t:0 "The Response"
changelings.67.d:0 ""...And that is why I shall not rest until Chrysalis's regime of tyrants and murderers is reduced to dust!"\nThat was the end of a speech, delivered by radio, of the still-living Thorax. In it, he explained how he was still alive, his desire to keep up the fight, and who his new owner was. Of course, that last one wasn't said in so many words, but there was no doubt that this powerful transmission was coming from the same nation that he named.\nRemarkably, none of the changelings at the meeting seemed particularly upset. Queen Chrysalis's expression didn't change at all. Neither did Dieter's. Vaspier still had his trademark hollow smile. The others, mostly Vesalipolis police and civil leaders, did what they could to follow suit, but they weren't happy. After a minute of them all sitting there, the message began to play again, and Chrysalis turned the radio off.\nVaspier stood up. "I should probably go and fix this", he said, as if it was a minor technical error.\nNobody reacted until he was nearly at the door. Queen Chrysalis, without turning to look at him, said, "You aren't thinking big enough."\nVaspier stopped, before saying, "You're right, my Queen," and leaving."
changelings.67.a:0 "I wonder what he'll come up with."

changelings.68.t:0 "VOPS Audited"
changelings.68.d:0 "In a sub-underbasement, Captain Dieter Heinrich reviewed his notes with Vaspier on the recent audit of VOPS. Though it was supposed to be independent, Dieter knew that his own report wasn't entirely correct, as Vaspier liked to keep secrets just a little too much. Still, he was comparing his incomplete version with the Nobody's doctored version to see if there were any small mistakes in the lie to pry into. \n"Four Thoraxians. Really."\nVaspier, still smiling, responded, "I might not be perfect, but I'm still the best..." Dieter immediately knew that, secretly, a number of "non-issue" harmonists and discontents had been moved out of the way. This habit was another thing that concerned him, but everyone said it wasn't worth replacing the spymaster over. "...Of course, it would have been zero if I hadn't gotten lazy with the reviews. I guess I'll be back to doing them myself."\nFinding no issue to raise which he hadn't already raised before, Dieter relented. "Well, I'll tell the Queen that this is all in order once again. It goes without saying, but let's not have this happen a second time."\n"I wouldn't worry about it", Vaspier responded, knowing how much dismissiveness like that got under the skin of the necessarily-paranoid Guard Captain."
changelings.68.a:0 "YOU will."

changelings.69.t:0 "Revenge"
changelings.69.d:0 "Late in the night, Vanhoover was directly struck by a series of meteors. Witnesses report bright lights coming over the horizon before getting closer, until they landed in streets and buildings, shattering windows and causing some casualties. This is odd, as meteor-sweepers found large amounts of high-grade metal scrap rather than the usual magical space-debris. Similarly, the meteors (eight in total) seem to have exploded before reaching the ground like a bomb, rather than pounding into it directly.\nFor these reasons, it is suspected that these were not meteors, but that this was a test deployment of a Changeling weapon prototype. The remains are too damaged to see, but it appears to be a self-propelled bomb launched from the south-western corner of the nation. Naturally, the Changeling state has taken credit for the "meteor shower", citing the harboring and assistance of their most-wanted. They denied that it was a weapon system, instead laying the credit with their archmages, despite this not being something changeling magic can do.\nLuckily, the weapons are very immature, and while they all managed to explode, only half hit the city, and the small payloads left one dead and fifteen injured. We do not know how many were supposed to be launched, and it's thought that this is the second attempt.\nRegardless, the prospect of it happening again and again forever has a number of economics types thoroughly irked, and they have requested that there not be a next time."

Heavy casualties are being reported, and it seems like the situation in Olenia is about to become a bloodbath. While we are not exactly sure on the reasons for war, one thing is for certain:  Olenia is in dire straits.\n\nAny offers for diplomatic intermediation from a third party have been bluntly rejected by Queen Chrysalis. She says this is a dispute between Olenia and the Changeling Lands, and will be resolved shortly. Thus, intervention from other countries is unnecessary.\n\nWe were unable to stop the outbreak of war, and now we need to decide what to do. We could either issue an official protest condemning either side for causing hostilities, or simply say nothing and stay out of the matter. It is likely that, once the changelings are done with Olenia, they will demobilize their army and remain content with what they have."

CHN_DESC_TRIMMEL:0 "§YBorn§!: 17 May, 973 in Gardis\n§YRank§!: Hives' Marshall\n§YBiography§!: Born to a low level administrator of the Hive of Gardis, Trimmel Eugen Heydrich Zu Gardis has always been destined for service to the state. Second born to his parents, he was generally viewed as the spare and allowed to choose his education as he saw fit, whereas his older sister was groomed for inheriting their dynastic position. Thus with such freedom in choice Trimmel chose the one thing he excelled at: War. At age 18 Trimmel joined the local 124th Infantry Regiment as an ensign, in 992 he was moved to begin studying at the Officer Cadet School in Vesalipolis. He graduated in November 993 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in January the following year where he was posted to various locations in Equestria after being assigned to 46th Infiltrator Brigade. He gained the attention of his superiors during the Winter Strike, where his connection with the coordination officer was severed and he took initiative. Through an expert use of oration, trickery, and outright violence, he was able to turn his persona into a folk hero that turned the civil dispute into a civil war. After leading dozens of raids, organizing his own personal army out of vagabonds and ideologues, and throwing his personal weight behind the most uncompromising movement he could find, he masterfully disappeared with the rest of his unit. From there, he was made an upper officer immediately, and his ideas about fully utilizing Dieter's "panzer" designs ensured his promotions stayed speedy. Finally, during the 1002 Invasion, his own strategy seemed to outclass that of even Synovial, and thus the title of Hive's Marshall was transferred to him.\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

CHN_DESC_DIETER:0 "§YBorn§!: §RUnknown§!\n\n§YRank§!: Captain\n\n§YBiography§!: No one knows sure sure what sort of hellscape birthed the changeling known as Dieter Heinrich. He simply emerged one day in 982 from the monster-infested woods of Dim Garden, already dressed in the now iconic pitch black uniform of Chrysalis's Officery, armed with the first MP-90, and able to speak four languages, none of which were Changeling. Only five years later, in the final days of the Unification, the Prandialist splinter movement he founded joined with Queen Chrysalis as the "Vhy". During the Great Betrayal, his duties expanded as he replaced the old Guard Captain. Now, the Vhy, and the Queen's Guard it feeds, is one of the most terrible and fanatic organizations on the continent. He is also one of the most significant figures in the nation's industrial, governmental, and especially martial revolutions.\n\nBut that's not quite the whole story. To those who know him, Dieter is far less impressive than his pedigree implies. He is moody, easily-upset, and comparatively unintelligent. The secret is that his ideas are not his own: He claims they come from a past life, where he fought in a global war for the most glorious empire in the planet's history. Their relative advanvement in doctrines are what he has granted to the Queen from memory. Now that his fourty-book compendium on this history is long finished, many wonder why he is still around, both for political reasons, and personal ones.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Flake"

CHN_DESC_RECINA:0 "§YBorn§!: July 23rd 976, in Ditrysium\n\n§YRank§!: High Admiral\n\n§YBiography§!: Recina is a curious sight among the Changeling Admiralty, being the only Royal Admiral, and a Princess at that. Hatched a few minutes too late after Queen Helvia, their mother left Recina mostly to fend for herself and focused instead on Helvia. As a result of her upbringing consisting of mostly being surrounded by drones more so than by her siblings and barely loved, Recina's physical status and magical capability are notably reduced for a Royal Changeling; so much so that she is mistaken for a Royal Male at times. Had it not been for Helvia's support and personal friendship, Recina may have wasted away as a nymph.\n\nHowever, Recina's innate knack for leadership is as sharp as that of any queen, and she found her calling in the navy, where she proved to be a very capable admiral. Ditrysium's submission to Queen Chrysalis and the subsequent mutiny of the Ditrysium sailours brought a halt to Recina's rise to fame, as the Vesalipolis Queen saw Recina as a threat, even though she had nothing to do with the mutiny. Recina's forced retirement was both unceremonious and a personal slight against her. Queen Chrysalis even planned to have Recina executed were it not for Helvia's timely intervention.\n\nBringing Recina out of retirement wasn't easy, for she had strong reservations against serving under Chrysalis. However, through Helvia's convincing and respect for her sister, Recina agreed to take on the job once more, this time under the leadership from Vesalipolis.\n\nAn aviation enthusiast, Recina brings to the forefront the importance of air power in naval combat and is the foremost proponent of carrier development, arguing that a naval airforce would be able to strike farther and harder than a conventional fleet.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

CHN_post_war_1_desc:0 "The Changeling Queendom reigns supreme across Equus. The Diarchy has fallen, and with it, the Equestrian nation-state, crushed under the panzer treads and jackboots of the Heer. From the ashes of the Great War, the incipient Pax Chrysalia extends its tendrils across the continent, to usher forth a new era of Changeling domination and prosperity."
CHN_post_war_1_a:0 "The Decompression"
CHN_post_war_1_a_desc:0 "At the peak of the war's intensity, the Changeling Hives were a nation who's sole existence was warfare, brutal and all-consuming. Now that victory is here, a police officer on a street corner can stop more attacks than a thousand planes. It is clear that our economy and culture must change with our role, from monster to master."
CHN_post_war_1_b:0 "Harbingers of Peace"
CHN_post_war_1_b_desc:0 "Winning the Great War was but the first step in the realisation of the Pax Chrysalia. Whilst our victorious troops occupy the smouldering ruins of Equestria's cities, the arduous task of asserting Changeling rule over the vast continental interior must begin apace. Every town, village, and hamlet, however inconsequential, must know their place as loyal possessions of their new Queen."
CHN_post_war_2:0 "Minions for the Queen"
CHN_post_war_2_desc:0 "It would take hundreds upon thousands of skilled, well-trained infiltrators to assume every single position of power on every level of Equestrian society. Thus: while the agents of the VOPS focus on the impersonation of a select few ponies of significance, the day-to-day of ruling over our Queen's new Equestrian subjects must, regrettably, be delegated to pony collaborationists of dubious reliability."
CHN_post_war_2_a:0 "The Cornucopia"
CHN_post_war_2_a_desc:0 "The tight cooperation between corporation and state has resulted in us having a unique way to take advantage of the newly-conquered territory. We need only place one of our own companies where there are strategic resources, and we can siphon them endlessly with no concern for profitability or sustainability."
CHN_post_war_2_b:0 "With Bark AND Bite"
CHN_post_war_2_b_desc:0 "Equestria was shattered in the Great War, but the ponies refuse to acknowledge defeat. Before the Heer lies the arduous and nigh-impossible task of enforcing the Pax Chrysalia upon a restive, resentful populace. Our approach to the occupation must be one that is flexible and pragmatic, capable of seizing every opportunity to chip away at the Equestrian spirit of defiance."
CHN_post_war_2_c:0 "No Rest for the Wicked"
CHN_post_war_2_c_desc:0 "Sizeable swathes of the Equestrian population languish in prison camps; POWs, dissidents, prominent pony leaders, and other undesirables. The amount of resources and personnel dedicated to their incarceration is severe. The formation of a penal service corps comprised of such ponies will allow them to pay us back by contributing to the economy as unskilled labour."
CHN_post_war_2_d:0 "Love and Tolerance"
CHN_post_war_2_d_desc:0 "Equestria the state is naught but ash, but Equestria the idea still lives. The Queen wishes for her race to impose their will on the ponies, but her race's will is to be fed and on top, and the rest is merely for prolonging it. If the conditions are right, we do not need to destroy Equestria, only make it placated and wait."
CHN_post_war_2_e:0 "Muzzle All Dissent"
CHN_post_war_2_e_desc:0 "Dissident thought must be weeded out before it can become infectious. The VOPS has a blacklist of outspoken Equestrians who are disproportionately influential. The Queen's Guard want to go further; any who speak out, changeling or pony alike, must be eliminated with maximum prejudice. After all, it only takes one voice to share an idea, and ideas, once shared, become the seeds for revolution..."
CHN_post_war_2_f:0 "Aid the Reconstruction"
CHN_post_war_2_f_desc:0 "While a self-sufficient Equestrian economy is not our goal, we can not be complacent in the impending socioeconomic collapse of our occupied territories. Offering conditional financial support to businesses will hopefully keep ponies employed and capital moving through the recovering economy of Equestria, which will, in the end, bring money back to the Hives."
CHN_post_war_2_g:0 "Revive War Production"
CHN_post_war_2_g_desc:0 "Before the Heer rolled into Equestrian cities, the war economy of the pony nation had been churning out equipment at such a high rate of production that it might have been able to rival our own, given time. While this fact should be hidden from the general public, we can take advantage of the captured Equestrian war industry put to enlarge and enhance our own military production capabilities."
CHN_vraks_looting_concern:0 "Das KuKC Erforschung- und Extraktion Konzern"
CHN_vraks_looting_concern_desc:0 "Having increased the demand for raw resources tenfold through the upscaling of military production, the Hives' capitalists now clamour for the creation of a central resource management agency administered jointly by the Changeling state and its corporations, to streamline the extraction of natural resources from territories across the Hegemony and their delivery to the factories of the Hives."
CHN_post_war_2_h:0 "Economic Hooks"
CHN_post_war_2_h_desc:0 "The process of rebuilding the Equestrian economy is one rife with business opportunities for the Hives' state-profit industry. In the name of cooperation, Equestrian companies are being turned into entities run by the occupation government as its own state-profit sector that brings foreign expertise and theory to an otherwise monoethnic field."
CHN_post_war_2_i:0 "Two Wrongs One Right"
CHN_post_war_2_i_desc:0 "The recent efforts on bringing back the sacred tradition of enslaving foreigners have revealed that, in a way, it never left. Every year, tens of thousands die in workplace accidents, and even the state only focuses on production over all. Now that we have won, we can change that."
CHN_post_war_2_j:0 "Convict Formations"
CHN_post_war_2_j_desc:0 "It is possible for Changelings to be de-citizened as a legal punishment, and forced to regain their citizenship with time in the army. With the end of the war, it is far less common, but it doesn't need to be. The Equestrian population is a source of new citizen-aspirants, and of ponies who do not have a choice in the matter."
CHN_post_war_2_k:0 "Case Overcast"
CHN_post_war_2_k_desc:0 "Coming into possession of Equestrian territory means we have also gained access to many testing sites and vast quantities of valuable research and knowledge, as well as the know-how of Equestrian scientists themselves. The VOPS will be tasked with the consolidation and conscription of all such assets, tangible and intangible, into the service of the Hives and the Heer."
CHN_post_war_2_l:0 "The Queen's Own Thestral Jägers"
CHN_post_war_2_l_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis was rather pleased by the formation of the RPVC; more specifically, with the imagery of pony soldiers serving in Changeling uniform. She has requested the creation of a new personal bodyguard unit comprised of thestral soldiers trained in jaeger tactics, as a symbol of her rulership over Equestria — after all, even Celestia herself could not command the loyalty of the thestrals."
CHN_post_war_2_m:0 "The Seaddle Protocol"
CHN_post_war_2_m_desc:0 "The brainchild of Minister of Science Marsilio, the Seaddle Protocol is a regulatory and doctrinal manual for the efficient and sustainable extraction of Love from the Equestrian populace. The Queen's Guard view the Protocol's constraints on Love harvesting with apprehension, but Marsilio's allies see it as the only way to achieve a stable working relationship between Changeling dependents and Pony providers."
CHN_post_war_3:0 "Rule of the High Tower"
CHN_post_war_3_desc:0 "Atop the Great Queen's Tower that dominates the Vesalipolis skyline, the Queen holds court, presiding over her empire. Within the lavish offices in the topmost stories, all the way down to the Tower's hive-like subterranean levels, armies of bureaucrats tirelessly toil to carry out the functions of the Changeling state. As the Hegemony grows to engulf Equestria, so too does the Tower's reach."
CHN_post_war_3_a:0 "VOPS Proliferation"
CHN_post_war_3_a_desc:0 "It would not be much of an exaggeration to call the VOPS the most powerful intelligence agency in the world. Certainly, the services of the infiltrator corps have proved indispensable during the Great War. With the dawn of the Pax Chrysalia, the focus of the VOPS now turns from espionage to counterinsurgency, to engage in the unenviable task of seeing that the fragile post-war peace endures across Equestria."
CHN_post_war_3_b:0 "Victor's Justice"
CHN_post_war_3_b_desc:0 "As we have won, it is our luxury to decide what to do with the Equestrian military high command and other major leaders, who have comitted many atrocities by their own laws.

CHN_post_war_3_g:0 "Nip it in the Bud!"
CHN_post_war_3_g_desc:0 "The resistance that covers much of Equestria is like a cancer, or like a strangling vine choking the life out of the glory of the Pax Chrysalia.

We must destroy the resistance while it is still small, or suffer the consequences when it grows even larger!"

Improvisieren, anpassen, überwinden!"
CHN_post_war_3_i:0 "Meritocratic Promotions"
CHN_post_war_3_i_desc:0 "The Queen's Guard expanded hugely in the aftermath of the Great War, and their sycophants are more numerous than ever. The Royal Changeling Heer has not grown quite as fast; instead, we have had to downsize to better ration our Love reserves. With the limited amount of promotions we can give out, we must pick the best candidates not merely by their devotion to the Queen, but by their success in battle."
CHN_post_war_3_j:0 "Preinterrogation"
CHN_post_war_3_j_desc:0 "Simple logic says that there is something which seperates rebels from non-rebels, and that the proper way of observing the population can find that difference before it comes out in fire and blood.

CHN_post_war_4:0 "Triumph of the Hives"
CHN_post_war_4_desc:0 "With the utter and total defeat of Equestria in the Great War, the humiliation of the Canterlot Defeat in 1002 has been rightfully avenged. Future generations of changelings shall know of the glorious triumph of their forebears over the perfidious Equestrian nation, whose alicorn monarchs were ultimately no match for the masterful cunning and strategic brilliance of the Great Queen Chrysalis."
CHN_post_war_4_a:0 "Military Modernisation"
CHN_post_war_4_a_desc:0 "Emerging battle-hardened from the Great War, the Heer is the sword and shield of the Pax Chrysalia. Where our technological superiority and doctrinal innovation had given us a clear advantage over the Equestrians, the neverending process of modernising the military must continue apace if the Heer is to maintain its edge in the imminent arms race with whatever power arises as hegemon in Griffonia."
CHN_post_war_4_b:0 "Replace the Antique"
CHN_post_war_4_b_desc:0 "The Equestrian Heartland is, and always will be, under our firm control. In order to begin making our demands known, we shall erase a major symbol of the Equestrian royal clique - the Castle of Frienship, the base of operations for the Element-Bearers."

CHN_post_war_4_d:0 "Project Living Space"

changelings_paxchrysalia.1000.d:0 "It is finally over.\n\nAfter countless months of bloody struggle, Equestria has finally succumbed to our victorious armies. On every battlefield in every theatre, the pony armies have been routed, crushed, and scattered to the winds. The enemy's organized resistance has been put to an end, and its leaders - those who haven't fled into exile, at least - have formally surrendered in Canterlot. The Great War is over.\n\nBut while the changelings back home pour into the streets in celebration from Vraks to Vesalipolis, those 'lings tasked with garrisoning our new gains are far from jovial. For while Equestria's armed forces lie in ruin, the fighting spirit of the ponies now under changeling rule will be much harder to pacify. As former soldiers melt back into their hometowns with fresh scars and painful memories of the bitter fighting on the front, the civilian population is beginning to mobilize in a way it hadn't during the war. There is much work to be done if we want to guarantee our hold over Equestria will stand the test of time.\n\nQueen Chrysalis has proclaimed this new era the "Pax Chrysalia", but those words are less of a celebration and more of a threat.\n\nConquering Equestria was the easy part. Holding on to it will be a much harder task."

Presiding over a mountain of captured Equestrian flags  —  many still battle-scarred and bloodstained  —  Queen Chrysalis declared the dawn of a Golden Age for the changeling race, having cast off the shackles of foreign suppression to assume their birthright as the terrible lords of Equus.\n    Whilst the Queen's speech was met with overwhelming popular approval, the future of the Pax Chrysalia remains uncertain. The intense militarism of the hives and the robustness of the changeling military-industrial complex had propelled the Queendom to victory, but with the Equestrian menace vanquished, the transition to peacetime may be a whole new kind of struggle - one which costs us what we might not want to pay."

The victory, the Queen proclaimed, has saved the changeling race from extinction by assimilation at the hands of foreign owners who would see them reduced to undercreatures and servants. She attributed the victory to superior spirit, heaping praise upon the Changeling armed forces personnel, while shouting a scathing rebuke of "ignorant peace" that left Equestria invasion. Unexpectedly, while the speech was nationalistic, it was not as racial as the regime's normal rhetoric. Non-changeling members of the Changeling army were metioned, and complimented as invaluable allies.\n    She finished by promising that Changeling supremacy over Equus would last for "a thousand years", and would let no Changeling be without a healthy life."

changelings_paxchrysalia.801.t:0 "A Royal Problem"
changelings_paxchrysalia.801.d:0 "Major General Jachs scribbled his signature onto yet another directive that had crossed his desk and let out a sigh, which resonated off of the walls of the basement of the Canterlot Castle. For its central location and sturdy construction, the Major General and his staff had set up their temporary headquarters there, pending the construction of a dedicated command center. It was also where they lived, the flurry of paperwork and decisions being so overwhelming that acquiring real lodging was comparatively low-priority, along with basic self-care.\n\nThe doors to his makeshift office opened, and a female drone with a pleasant smile entered, exposing the room to the sounds of dozens of typewriters and mechanical calculators in the halls outside. She saluted perfectly in front of him, dropped a folder down, and said, "Major-General! Direct orders from the Queen!"\n\nThe exhausted Jachs wanted to pass out, but instead, he replied, "I'm sorry, but could you read it to me?" \n\nThe drone, Lieutenant Alcippe, cleared her throat and began. "Major-General Jachs. Reinforcements have been dispatched from the bureaucracy and accounting corps, as well as logistics. The papers beneath are your new primary objective. In summation, there shall be a grand parade celebrating our victory, which you will organize. It will display our military might and domination, and will be how generations to come see this day, hence why it requires your full attention.\n\n"There is also a decision to be made. For political reasons, it is best that this parade show off such things as prized captives, large crowds, and Equestrian nobility bowing to us. However, my head of security advises me that it is unsafe to be so close to masses of ponies at this time. As it is your region, I am leaving it to you to make the choice. Dictated by Master of the Armies, Queen Chrysalis.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.2.t:0 "The Queen's Canterlot Rally"
changelings_paxchrysalia.2.d:0 "The Major-General struggled to stay awake as the parade entered hour five. The past two weeks had seen him working more off of love shamefully stolen from ponies pulled from the streets than off of sleep, and he had been overworked to begin with. In spite of that, a flight of jets screamed overhead on a low pass, and he could only smile. He could imagine how proud he would be watching the film being taken when he was better-rested.\n\nThe Queen sat a few seats over, and was trying very hard to maintain a royal façade, but cracks appeared from time to time, usually centered around her massive grin, which she had had since the start. Today, nothing could dampen her spirits.\n\nThis was lucky because the event wasn't perfect. When her soldiers had broken out into an inappropriate and borderline treasonous song mid-march, she took it with good humor (it was indeed very funny). When the nobility brought forth to swear oaths of fealty to their new ruler had to be made to bow with a rifle butt, she still didn't seem that torn-up. In general, the ponies dragged out to be spectators were livid, but who cares what they think? Their love fills regardless.\n\nThe fact is, this parade was another façade, erected to hide the upcoming disaster that made Jachs's head hurt to think about. Not just because it would be up to him to clean it up, but because he couldn't expect help. He was probably the only Changeling in the high stands who would still give a damn about that if they weren't being paid to.\n\nIn a few years, the memory of this event would come with a bad taste in your mouth. He hoped that the audience enjoyed it while they still could."

changelings_paxchrysalia.3.d:0 "The Major-General struggled to stay awake as the parade entered it's fifth and final hour. The Queen, only a few seats away, was disappointed, but hardly upset. She had a chief of security for a reason. And besides, it was still a fantastic parade. Jets on low flyby's, thousands of soldiers marching in perfect sync, all the heaviest tanks the road could survive, the works.\n\nThat said, there probably were a few too many guards at the swearing of the nobility. Everyone knew that the words were hollow. And the vastly-reduced crowds were nothing to write home about, either. All in all, it was a net positive, but not the beginning of an era it could have been.\n\nAt the after-party, in the main ballroom of the Canterlot Castle, Jachs wound-up face to face with that chief of security, Captain Dieter, who looked profoundly unhappy as he nursed a glass of water. "Did the Queen give you a hard time about the reduced size of the parade?"" Jachs asked, hoping to break the ice.\n\n"She defeated a god once. She forgets that that doesn't make her immune to sniper fire... but then she remembers." He replied emotionlessly. Jachs was regretting talking to him. "You made the right choice. These creatures are children of the Helvetinkatse. You can't trust them."\n\n"The... what?" Jachs asked uncomfortably. That word sounded Olenian.\n\n"The Helvetinkatse, the ancestral spirit of evil. They created ponies in their own image to stand forever against the master race."\n\nJachs considered this for a second, and said, "I get it, and it's good to know, but I do need to get going," lying through his teeth on all of it."

changelings_paxchrysalia.4.t:0 "Who is Right and Who is Left"
changelings_paxchrysalia.4.d:0 "Recently, a case came to the attention of the occupational authorities. It concerned the sentence of Brigadier-General Latranjer, and his late-war escapades. This case has gained much attention in the Equestrian press for being a clear example of how changeling justice differs from pony justice. For instance, the soldiers who carried out the misdeeds will be spared in most cases, since they would have been executed if they had refused to carry out orders, and at least this way they are still alive for the Queen to deal with herself. The officers have no such excuse, and nearly all of them are guaranteed a death sentence.\n\nThe question is how, or more accurately, who. Normally, officers misbehaving in the line of duty are sentenced according to military law. However, some argue that trying them under civilian court is the prudent course of action. The difference is technical, but highly symbolic. Under civilian law, he and his officers will be punished for the pain he caused to the victims, while under military law, what they did is irrelevant except that they had been ordered by Queen Chrysalis to not do it. Naturally, ponies want to hear that their lives have some sort of intrinsic value, because they're like that. It’s a compromise that is within doctrine, but the issue is that, as part of the military organization, Latranjer and his officers are supposed to be exempt from civilian law. That means it would involve bending the rules to accommodate the ponies’ desire, and in a way which most changelings would consider to be a bad precedent both legally and politically."

changelings_paxchrysalia.5.d:0 ""Is there anything left out, Minister?"\n\nMinister of Science Marsilio looked into the room at his new Seaddle office and said, "It doesn't seem like it. Thank you very much." The soldier saluted and walked off as Marsilio sat down at his desk for the first time and looked over the hundreds of pages of reports in front of him. Quiet, well-stocked, filled with nice furniture to sit and write on... this office, as well as the rest of the new branch of the Science Ministry, was built in an old Olenian administrative building, but besides the eerily tall antler-accommodating ceilings, he had nothing to complain about except the job itself. He pulled some jerky out of a drawer and began.\n\nHis task was to fix the supply of love, which had some very obvious issues due to being essentially strip-foraging. The truth was that the scale was only becoming apparent now, as he skimmed report after report. High efficiency was a lost cause, which was bad, but the obvious and massive mathematical errors explained with "measurement confirmed, cause unknown" were even worse. In all of his notes, it seemed that nobody knew what was going on at all, only that it was basically functional at the cost of horrid wastefulness.\n\nWell, that pathetic "best attempt" by the armies was why it had fallen entirely on his group's shoulders rather than just having them as counsel. He was the state wrangler of technocrats, so if anyone could figure out how to make the needs of the state balance with the amount that could be safely harvested, it was him. In the meantime, the army would need to slow down its institutionalized raiding to keep something especially bad from happening. It would put him on a time limit to figure it out, since the victorious soldiers wouldn't sit idle and hungry forever, but he was pretty sure he could pull it off."

changelings_paxchrysalia.6.d:0 ""...As you can see, the math does not work out on paper, much less in reality. Bearing in mind the values involved, we can change four of them, these ones here, but these three violate an edict from the Queen directly, and the last one is reducing the size of the army, which is a good idea for the current national goals already. I have calculated a method which I believe will satisfy all conditions and leave us with a sufficient army to handle any remaining threat." With that, Marsilio paused to invite questions.\n\nThe first came from Trimmel, who spoke for the dozen Heer and Evevehr officers besides him. It also was not a question. "That is unacceptable. The army is our strength as a nation made manifest. To reduce it is to invite disaster in a massed revolt."\n\nMarsilio, who had a similar role to the dozen-odd civil and economic leaders on his side of the table, responded. "A revolt so large we need the current army will be avoided easily if we use more sustainable harvesting practices."\nTrimmel shot back, "And what of our new neighbors? I am the Queen's word on the Heer, and I say it stays."\n"And I am the Queen's word on love harvesting, and I say it gets reduced."\nTrimmel and his staff looked to Dieter, sitting at the head of the table, to break the tie. Marsilio and his did the same. Dieter himself was limp in his chair, staring at nothing. When he noticed that everyone was staring, he turned around to check if someone was behind him, realized they were waiting on him to speak, and racked his brain for some aphorism related to the topic. "...You can conquer from the saddle, but not rule from it." The mood died instantly at the horribly crude remark, and nobody could figure out how it related, so it was silently resolved to take this to the Queen herself."

changelings_paxchrysalia.8.d:0 "As he walked through the halls, Minister Marsilio could only suppose that what happened was the natural result of having such a wise leader as Queen Chrysalis. In under an hour of discussion between him, her, and Trimmel, she had seen fit to decide in favor of his own plan. Really, there was no reason to try and force through even more collections when the Changeling army was already the best in the world.\n\nNow, his mind turned to organizing the harvest under the "Seaddle Protocol", which was the responsibility of a division under his banner. The process was fairly simple. Every month, harvesters would come by and drain some love from half of the population of whatever town they were at. Not enough to do permanent damage, but still some. Then, a month later, they would come back and get the other half. It was easy, scalable, repeatable, and about as non-intrusive as it could get. The current system was basically nothing, and the one before was massed brigandry, so even if it wasn't a great quantity of collected love, it was still a vast improvement.\n\nBest of all? Because it was so basic to grasp, and so basic to do, it wouldn't be hard at all for the ponies to adapt to it as a part of life just like the other taxes."

Due to the lack of sustainable love collection methods mixed with an edict to stop large-scale harvesting until such methods are implemented, the armed forces of the Changeling state are being forced to go with almost as little as during the later Century of Hunger.\n\nThe soldiers are finding individual solutions, which are becoming increasingly colorful as discipline in this matter slips. What started as late-night grave robbery to recycle fresh corpses has now expanded to kidnapping and eating streetwalkers and the homeless. A large, impromptu racket of bribery and threats has also cropped up to try and stop news of these behaviors leaking to the upper ranks. Naturally, the locals are furious about this behavior. To make matters worse, our own citizenry are siding with the soldiers instead of with our administration!\n\nHeads of the Vhy and Heer have defended the behavior, citing "abandonment of our most revered brethren", and laid the blame at the feet of the ministers responsible for finding a solution to the love crisis in a timely manner. Few promises were made about stopping the shameful activities in the meantime."

Most watched the changelings gathered around with anxious looks, instinctively huddling closer together as they warily eyed the changelings manning the perimeter with rifles and machine guns. A few soldiers rounded up the stragglers hiding inside of their homes, and within an hour, the entire population of the town had been brought together.\n\nMarsilio kept a keen eye trained on the faces of the ponies as the changelings split the assembled ponies into two groups. Then, leading one group forward, they began to power up the machinery gathered around them. A pink glow surrounded the ponies, causing many to flinch or cry out... but their cries faded away into confused murmuring as nothing drastic or terrible happened. In a few seconds it was all over, leaving the assembled ponies looking a little sluggish and tired, but none the worse for wear. The rest of the assembled changelings dismissed them, packing up the equipment, and politely reminding the other half of the town that they would be back in a month for their turn. As the two groups reunited in the middle of town, surprised whispers bounced back and forth between them, with many ponies watching with disbelief as the changelings readied themselves to move on. There was even a little bit of laughter as the two sides shared a few embraces.\n\nMarsilio allowed himself the tiniest hint of a smile as he climbed back into the passenger seat of the collection truck. Laughter was good. That meant it hadn't been too traumatizing for those involved. And if the ponies were able to laugh about it once it was all over, then the next collection would be even easier. Given enough time, the simple Love harvests would become just another part of life for these ponies."

Her guards, standing perfectly at attention, filtered out of the massive chamber and closed the door behind them.

I wish to hear it in your own words. Remember that I can taste dishonesty."\n\nJachs's breathing stopped. This was a trick, a test of his ideological purity, but how to get out of it? He didn't want to end up on a lamppost like a Thoraxian, but what could he say? He had no choice but to do as she asked and hope that she was merciful. "I... do not agree that the ponies are an inferior race... They seem to be, uh, just as clever and dedicated as I am, and, and their way of life is, uh, much more peaceful than ours, and I have spent too long fighting them to think they're stupid and weak."\n\nQueen Chrysalis heard his stumbling, fear-soaked excuse, and calmly replied, "I agree."

"I have spent twenty years building a fanaticism that the world has never seen, and now I must dismantle it before I am buried under narrow-minded psycopaths, or by them. Governor, hear this and remember! What I want is a thousand-year imperium. Not ten years, or a hundred, a thousand. It will require sacrifice on both sides.

changelings_paxchrysalia.13.d:0 "Minister Marsilio sat outside the main room of the Monarchist Council, waiting with a few of his aides for them to make a decision. He had produced a series of propositions for Queen Chrysalis on ways to effectively use surplus love for things besides the military, but since she was in Canterlot yet again, it fell to the Council to deliberate. This was unfortunate, as they were less concerned with the morality of popular support programs like these, but at least there were concrete utility arguments. The value in workers who can work 14-hour days without issue was self-evident. The Queens also tended to have less respect for changelings from minor hives and for non-royals, of which Marsilio was both.\n\nHe had not remembered to bring a copy for himself, so he had nothing to do while they poured over his notes. Apparently his aides had better foresight: two were playing Changeling Chess disguised to look like a briefcase, and were both in the post-Queen phase (somehow). The rest were watching them. Marsilio would join them, but he had to be alert in case a decision was made.\n\nIt turned out to be the right train of thought because just then a well-dressed changeling who spoke for Queen Argynnis appeared from the Council's room. He floated back the pile of documents and said, "Your proposals are all accepted. Start at will."\n\nMarsilio bowed and said, "Thank you," before rallying his aides to begin. There was much work to be done, but at least for once the end goal was something he wanted to see."

Around her were a smattering of high officials, mostly Queen Aurantia of Lyctida and her aides as well as Hive's Marshall Trimmel and his. Chrysalis began. "I have brought you here to discuss the matter of the new restrictions brought on by our love economy. I believe I have found a way to give our land forces a little more leeway. We can re-task the "Special Ambassadors" to the Heer to act as a nonintrusive force for foraging love. It could also be positive outreach. What are your thoughts?" Twenty years ago, the Special Ambasadors had been a dedicated force for diplomatic infiltration, and was a pillar of the state's strategy to build up in peace. Now that their nation was powerful enough that others had to treat it like a real entity, the SA was struggling to find a purpose.\n\nTrimmel spoke first. "My Queen, I think this is the correct course of action, but we would still need to check with VOPS first. They are currently our biggest experts on non-duress interrogation, and it could set back efforts to lose them."\n\nChrysalis, who had already gotten Vaspier's go-ahead, responded, "It was VOPS's idea, and they already have a plan to fill the role. If we go slow, we shouldn't have too much trouble. How about you, Queen Aurantia?"\n\nAurantia had been the original creator of the group, and her hive was its primary recruiting ground. Aurantia thought for a second, and answered, "It feels weird to see an organization you created turn into something completely different but still used. Either way, it's not really in my court anymore, is it? If you need my decision, then sure."\n\nQueen Chrysalis gave one last look around, and seeing that neither had any further concerns, said, "Then it is decided! The Special Ambassadors shall become a secondary love-gathering organ of the Heer!""

The angular white symbol of the Vhy flew besides the normal Changeling banners, as they were in charge of running the program. Below him, thousands of POW's stood around, being ushered into a long building one at a time. Because of the size of it, they couldn't tell that they weren't coming out the other side. In each of the chambers of the building, soldiers were taking pre-made cocoons out of crates, placing the prisoners into them, and then shipping the cocoon-filled crates by truck to Vevilsberg. There, they would spend the next few years being fed their happiest memories on repeat as their body slowly wasted away into a wrinkled husk not even worth eating. It made Marsilio feel sick.\n\nUndercaptain Carnara sat next to him, much less perturbed by the whole ordeal. "So far, it's going well. This should let us delay the Seaddle plan rollout until it's perfect and still have a massive reserve of love." He looked at Marsilio, sympathetically. Although he was good at his job as Minister, Marsilio was understood to have a mental illness that made it hard to separate the under-races from himself. He worked hard enough that nobody who mattered thought less of him for it. "I understand that that might not make you feel better, but I'm not sure what you were expecting."\n\nMarsilio didn't know what to say. "I just... I don't see why this is necessary."\n\nCarnara took a second to look at the multicolored crowd of emaciated prisoners. "The north is still a problem area. A critical uprising is still a risk. Demobilizing the army too fast would cause economic problems. The fact is, we need the army to stay how it is a while longer."\n\nThat made logical sense to Marsilio. He still felt like dying.

Chrysalis had, by all accounts, successfully brought back a Changeling tradition.\n\n"Excellent work, Minister. Is there anything else?" The Queen watched as the minister shifted uncomfortably. "Come on, spit it out."\n\nFinicus composed his thoughts and began. "At the risk of overstepping my boundaries, now is a good time to look at labor protections for citizens. The sustainability practices place slaves only one step below normal changelings in terms of worker protections. The status of foreign worker's rights is still uncertain when Equestria used to have some of the most robust worker's rights, depending on location."\n\nChrysalis's ears perked up. "That is overstepping your boundaries. That would lower productivity."\n\nFinicus replied, "I know, my Queen, and I am sorry, but I feel it is important that this situation be settled soon. This could be a major lasting political victory both at home and abroad, be something to build a legacy out of, and save many lives."\n\nChrysalis said, "I feel that there is some emotional baggage here. Maybe you do have a heart?" Finicus bowed again in apology. She continued, "No, don't be sorry. Part of the point of all this is that changelings could start learning what their best life is, rather than living to create the next short-lived victory.

As he entered, he saw that the argument was between Queen Argynnis and a yellow-eyed changeling drone with a plastic grin who he'd never seen before. "What's going on?"" He asked Dieter. "Who is that?"\n\nDieter pointed to the bickering pair. "They're having an argument about enforcement. Queen Argynnis wants us to take a hard, zero-tolerance stance on anti-occupation language. Imprisonment, public executions, replacement, whatever it takes. That other one thinks we shouldn't be that harsh on the poor old ponies who did nothing wrong. They are both very certain of their positions."\n\nJachs thought for a second, and said, "Well, that explains it. But who is that guy?"\n\nDieter looked at him sternly and demanded, "All you need to know is that he's VOPS. The point is, since you were brought here to be part of the council and you'll be the one acting on the decision, you might as well try and break the tie."\n\nJachs looked across the large chamber and saw Queen Chrysalis on her jagged throne, ready to pull apart the feud if it turned physical. Both sides were gesturing so wildly that it nearly was already. The unknown bug, who's identity was doubtless some sort of secret because Dieter said not to think about it, was alone, while Argynnis's attendants were backed off quite a ways.\n\nHe could rule in favor of short-term success with the harsher campaign, or long-term success they might not see with the lighter one.

He had been part of a program to determine the most economically and culturally valuable ponies who were likely to collaborate willingly with the Changeling state, and this was the first batch of results.\n\nGathered behind him were representatives from some minor noble houses, a few officers who deserted or inexplicably defected, and a cadre of wealthy businessponies. In other words, pig-lords, cowards, and race traitors, and a few who were even worse. Considering that the good Lady of Amethyst had just committed a corporal offence with her rude remark, he hoped that they got the new rules through their skulls quickly. But they were going to be the vanguard of the new collaboration movement, and he also hoped that placing these undesirables in the front of anything significant could ever turn out well without involving an unmapped minefield.\n\nOne of the Queen's guards opened the door, and Finicus walked to the front of the room. "It is starting, but before we begin, I would like to remind you all one last time that Queen Chrysalis demands politeness. As she is understanding, you are being allowed to use Equestrian politeness ritual. You still must do it properly, or else you will be beaten and then ejected. Disrespect will not be tolerated. For those of you who have no experience with high society, follow what I do." He could sense the barely-hidden glares and bolts of fear that reverberated through the small crowd. The ones who knew the stakes might become something. The ones who didn't... wouldn't. At least it was someone else's job to clean up the mess."

changelings_paxchrysalia.22.d:0 "Minister Finicus stared at the map of Equestria in front of him, laced with dotted lines and sitting besides a massive spreadsheet. It was the updated Equestrian map created by one General-Major Jachs and co. for use in determining where regions begin and end for the governorships of the nation. The spreadsheet was part of Finicus's job, and it was judging the probable economic value of every zone and how it was so. This was important because Changeling companies would want to try and buy stakes in regions for extraction, processing, etc.\n\nThe crucial equation was that virtually every large Changeling company was not only state-owned, but owned directly by the hive's Queen as an extra revenue stream for the treasury (which was also owned directly by the local Queen). Queens weren't fans of selling their companies to other hives for that reason, on top of old autarkic habit. Therefore, the only way for one to go out of business was for an entire hive to become insolvent, which wasn't going to happen in the foreseeable future to a hive that could afford these regional stakes. It would not be economically healthy for these new regions to have their local companies replaced by pre-existing ones that were going to be there forever no matter how efficient they weren't, but it could be strategically healthy for the broader Queendom to have first- or second-pick of the outputs via their own companies.\n\nThus, it made sense to let it happen... sometimes. Finicus's job was part of figuring out when."

changelings_paxchrysalia.23.d:0 "With the Great War over and the ink drying in the history books, the time has come to turn the Hegemony's efforts from conquest to occupation. The newly instituted Case Overcast seeks to make the most out of the fallen remains of Equestria, gathering up pony scientists from the ruins of their old nation and firmly encouraging them to share their research and discoveries with the Hegemony. To oversee the enforcement of the plan, a committee of top changeling scientists, army officers, and industrial leaders has been organized in Vesalipolis to determine where these efforts should be directed first. Named the Hegemony Science and Industry Research Compact, or HSIRC for short, the newly established board of directors has gathered to determine what should take priority in the salvage and recovery operations before the Equestrian scientists go into hiding and their research is lost.\n\nThe board, however, is heavily divided. Representatives from the Queen's Guards abd the Vhy have insisted that the HSIRC prioritize military hardware and the recovery of advanced weaponry such as railway artillery and complicated electronics, while the high-ranking officers of the Heer have pushed back that the HSIRC should invest in rocketry and atomic science, as these frontiers will be the future of the battlefield. Still more demands have arisen from the sizeable faction of changeling industrialists and undercapitalists, who sense great opportunities for the Hegemony (and their own businesses) in learning from the ponies and having them teach us their technology instead of scavenging for it like vultures. As the HSIRC bogs down into a stalemate between the three factions, a decision must ultimately be made to prove that Case Overcast can be successful."

Instead, the leaders in the Vhy have taken it upon themselves to create newer, bigger, and more destructive weapons than anything currently in the Heer's arsenal. They argue that as the horrors of war slowly fade from the public consciousness, these new weapons are essential to remind the ponies that we are their masters and could now destroy them in worse ways than in the Great War to prevent them from rising up. To this end, they have forced plans through the rest of the HSIRC despite the rest of the council's protests, to acquire as many Equestrian scientists, engineers, and technicians to create a massive railway cannon, the likes of which has never been seen before.\n\nTermed the Soryth-Drer Rilwirkanen, the artillery piece, which will have an effective firing range of over 40km while delivering a shell carrying 700kg of high explosives, will weigh roughly 1,350 tonnes, be 47 meters in length, and require two parallel railway tracks for transportation.

changelings_paxchrysalia.25.d:0 "Minister Marsilio stood a safe distance away from the launch pad as the fueling trucks detached themselves from the rocket and scurried to safety. After spending long hours arguing with the HSIRC, the Heer had finally gotten its way, and pony scientists and engineers had been diverted to the rocketry programs that led by some of Marsilio's closest colleagues. The rocket, a metal tube standing fifteen meters tall with a cone on one end and four rudders on the other, glistened in the midday light. Though he was the Minster of Science, and was hence responsible for overseeing the centralised scientific efforts of the Hives, Marsilio's expertise was in the realm of biochemistry and medicine, and thus some of the finer details of the launch were lost on him. His colleagues did their best to explain how the liquid propellant system worked, and how the powerful engines allowed the rocket to achieve a range further than any artillery system currently in existence.\n\nThen the countdown began, and all eyes turned toward the rocket. Its base began to smoke, the cloud carried away by a slight breeze, and then a guttural roar burst out over the field. For a moment, Marsilio lost sight of the rocket in the cloud of debris, but then he saw its metal cone breach the top of the smoke cloud. It burst forward into the sky, a tail of blindingly white fire pushing it onwards, and soon it rose higher and higher and higher, climbing faster than any plane in the Evevehr's arsenal. He watched it disappear into the clear blue skies overhead, where eventually the nose pitched over and it began to descend toward the ocean to the west.\n\nAs the scientists and engineers around him cheered for a successful test, Marsilio's eyes lingered on the sky far above them. Changeling rocketry had come so far ever since getting the HSIRC's approval to fund these projects. One day, the rockets would be able to strike the Riverlands from the outskirts of Vesalipolis. But what if they could go further? What if, one day, those rockets could carry changelings up high above the sky, out to the moon... or even beyond?\n\nIt was little more than a pipe dream for now, but it gave Marsilio some hope that the advances the Heer made to wage war across the world could someday be used for peaceful purposes beyond this world."

Regionalism and privatization meant that companies would hoard proprietary medicines in order to control production for when they sell them to the distributors. Now we own nearly all of them." He prepared to take the final leap. "If we collected and translated all of the medical texts, we could create a compendium that would advance the standard of medicine by decades in poorer regions."

It was the Queen's most recent edict, and it was such an event that he had gathered as many governors as he could to go over it face-to-face.\n\nIn those few pages was the future plan for peacefully integrating the foreign territories into the Changeling way. It described a sliding scale of engagement with the central authority, with the minimum being paying taxes and hosting a garrison but being otherwise left untouched. It was shockingly tolerant, and it was economically discouraged. To work with the state, it was required to buy more and more into the Changeling way of life, building in the style and dressing in the clothes, and since the state directly owned much of the economy, that was almost necessary to truly get ahead. The edict also allowed anyone to purchase the contracts of temporary "servants" as under the same rules as a Changeling, although the "servants" were nearly all sold by the Changeling state, and ponies had little interest in owning slaves.\n\nThe first raised hoof was from a nervous, scrawny pony in the back. He began, "Looking at the part about indentured servants... Does this mean that we can buy them just to set them free early?"\n\nThat... was a good question, and not decided. On one side, it would follow the spirit of the law, and would increase income as ponies bought each other just to free them, increasing the demand and allowing the free-ponies to start paying taxes sooner. On the other, restoration of slavery had been a major promise for the monarchists, and they wouldn't be happy if supply died because of this. Nor would the soldiers who had died to restore an ancient Changeling tradition, and Jachs didn't dare disrespect dead veterans."

We have been finding a balance."\n\nJachs nodded. "Makes sense so far. Where do I come in?"\n\n"We had an idea, but it introduced many variables we had no information about. So I called you here. As we will have tens of thousands in direct government employ for years or decades, it would be easy to take the opportunity to indoctrinate them how we wish. We do not know if that is a good idea in the long run. It would produce more resilient slaves who are more amenable after they are released, but ponies would likely find it distasteful, and it is not clear to us exactly how "easy" it would be. Should we go through with it?"\n\nJachs thought for a second. "Firstly, they're "indentured servants", because slavery is another thing ponies hate. Secondly...""

changelings_paxchrysalia.33.d:0 "Major-General Jachs stood in the shadows of the gatehouse to Canterlot Castle, with nearly five thousand soldiers from the Disciplinary Group of the Changeling Hegemony staging in the castle grounds behind him. Their uniforms were kept perfectly, even if the modernity left something to be desired. Flawless training was a necessity in an army made of criminals and slaves. There was a nervous stillness in the air, as if the city itself knew that things were changing, and not necessarily for the better.\n\nLieutenant Alcippe straightened Jachs' hat with a glow of green magic and grinned at him. "About time you get a parade for your work," she said. "The Queen will be pleased to see what progress you've made in promoting compliance here in Canterlot."\n\n"Not just me, Lieutenant," Jachs said. He didn't mean that as a compliment, but Alcippe took it as one and averted her eyes as if to try and dodge it. "I'm taking some time off tomorrow, Alcippe. Feel free to do the same."\n\nThere wasn't much more to be said after that, as the tolling of the noon bells in Canterlot meant it was time to set out. Jachs shared one last look with Alcippe before blowing into a whistle and setting the parade of disciplinary troops moving, and he made his way to his staff car as the officers and NCOs — each made partially of ponies and changelings — took command of the parade from there. It was going to be a long day of marching and ceremony, but for the first time in quite a while, the Major-General had created it for himself. Hopefully the Queen would be pleased with the results. The Major-General was not."

Specifically, the fact that Queen Chrysalis was apparently caught off guard by its creation and wanted other's opinions on whether to keep it around at all. Minister of Central Equestria Jachs himself had just finished his reasoning for creating the units, an explanation peppered with profound national duty and blunt moral distaste in equal measure.\n\nCaptain Dieter started the responses. "If we must have mixed-race and penal units, combining the two as a frontline group is as good as it can get. My own investigations say that these are above-board, so I have to support them."\n\nHives' Marshall Trimmel spoke next. "I wholeheartedly support them. Truly disposable troops would be a great tool in our arsenal, and their diversity will make them better for international operations."\n\nQueen Argynnis followed. "As do I. On top of that, it is a triumph of civilization and our rulership against the riotous hordes."\n\nChrysalis responded, "I am surprised that you are not concerned by these units being pony-majority, Queen Argynnis."\n\nArgynnis shot back, "I am not half as concerned about our slaves slaving as you are that the first ponies to fight for you in large numbers did so with whips to their back. Or is this meeting not about your ego when everyone else agrees that this force is good?" Dieter shot her a deathly glare that made her stop, but the point was made.\n\nChrysalis looked pleadingly at Minister of Economics Finicus, who said, "They can recoup costs. Do international jobs. The economic impact of using slaves this way is not enough to justify recommending a shutdown."\n\nChrysalis paused, visibly swallowing her pride, and said...""

changelings_paxchrysalia.34.d:0 ""Major-General Jachs here. Who am I speaking to?" Jachs hadn't expected a phone call, but it was a nice distraction from the endless forms.\n\n"Captain Dieter. I have something I need to discuss with you." Said the phone defeatedly.\n\nJachs picked up a deck of playing cards to fidget with. "Oh, is this about me throwing your letters in the trash? That's a serious government channel, and I already told you that a racial caste system is directly against the charter."\n\nThere was a pause on the end of the line, followed by a heavy sigh. "No, it's about something else. The Queen told me to start making preparations for a new unit of guards made of Thestrals."\n\n"Dieter, I appreciate the effort, but your sense of humor needs more time in the forge." Then Jachs remembered how upset she was that the first multiethnic unit was utterly unrespectable, and the Thestral census he had recently received orders for... "You aren't joking, are you? Throw me in the ocean, Dieter, we have to stop her!"\n\n"We can't! Her heart's too dead-set on letting these animals into our army! That's why I'm calling you, so that you can prepare to not do it anyways."\n\nJach's mind started racing. "How much time do we have?"\n\n"I don't know, it's until she finds the time to write the order properly. Two days? Three?"\n\n"Alright, thanks for the heads-up. I'll see what I can do." This was so bad. It wasn't that the bats were bad creatures, although they did strain even Jach's tolerance. The problem was that they insisted on following their night goddess until the end of time. It was like they took joy from going against whoever was in charge to take guidance from elders and priests instead. They were not suited for the army. But could he stop this in time? If not, could he make it work? Could he... head her off before the order was made?"

His clock said it was midnight. His dream about hand grenades had been interrupted right before it got into the effects on people he DIDN'T like, and it was by the Thestral Guard.\n\nUndercaptain Carnara appeared in the door with a host of Queen's Guard in tow, and more running behind him to the Queen's quarters. "Captain Dieter, it's the bats" We have them in the entrances, but the Panzermotorized are still five minutes out and there's a breach in West Gate 3!"\n\nDieter threw on a coat and grabbed his sidearm from his nightstand. "I see the Queen's personal detail is in place. How much do you want to bet that the West Lobby's about to need reinforcements?"\n\nCarnara replied, "It's good odds. Teams Prism, Occult, follow us!" Around twenty changelings in lacquered blue armor, with Breakers and a crew-served lightning gun, formed up out of the mass of rushing soldiers. Dieter took to the halls and started to march to where the fighting was about to get thickest, popping a few crystalline tablets as he walked.\n\nDue to the cramped layout of the hive, it took under a minute to get there. Not even enough time for the amphetamines to kick in. Dieter levelled his gun at the front door and watched it as the rest of the force took up positions behind desks, pillars, or chairs. The low hum of the lightning cannon being armed almost drowned out the faint screeching and scrabbling of untold numbers of bats armed with the same armor and weapons courtesy of Queen Chrysalis herself."

He had added six to his personal kill tally.\n\nQueen Chrysalis appeared from his peripheral vision. The medic said something he couldn't make out except for "unresponsive", and the Queen yelled, "CAPTAIN DIETER, STATUS REPORT!"\n\nDieter forced out some words which sounded like, "All threats eliminated, my Queen, survivors are being dealt with outside."\n\nChrysalis looked worried. "Dealth with?"\n\n"Of course. Shot, bayonetted, strangled, I don't know, all I said was to keep the skulls intact in case you want to do something with them." Dieter was in too much pain to realize that, in a few days, this whole ordeal would be censored and buried, and all traces removed. No victory parade. "Just give me a couple hours to rest, and I'll be good again. I'll be able to get back to protecting you from... from your own guards." Dieter was in no state to notice that he had just delivered a massive insult. Chrysalis, standing in a chamber echoing with doctors and pained groans caused by not listening to him earlier, was in no state to take it too seriously. The panzer-soldier guards and panzermotorized dismounts milling about the room did not feel like questioning it either, when they were secretly thinking the same thing.\n\nIn a few days, the entire battle, which lasted only half an hour, would be practically forgotten."

changelings_paxchrysalia.38.d:0 "The Vesalipolis Office of Public Safety has recently started upscaling recruitment and training efforts to stuff its ranks full of trained infiltrators to disperse on deep cover operations throughout Equestria, with the intent on locating and cracking down on resistance groups and dissenters throughout the nation to tighten changeling grip on the land. Although they haven't been explicit about this, it's not hard to guess due to the side-effects being fairly obvious, alongside the odd direct mention. The intended effect has arisen almost immediately: all throughout Equestria, ponies no longer trust their neighbors or POWs returning home from war out of the well-grounded fear that they could be changeling infiltrators. Resistance groups are struggling to find traction as the knowledge that anypony could be a changeling in disguise makes them more cautious than ever. Pony unity against the Hives is fragmented, making it increasingly difficult for Equestrians to come together and resist our rule. With outsiders becoming ostracized within local communities at an ever-increasing rate, informal communication across Equestria is beginning to slow down — and not so for our controlled communication. All of this is making the nation easier to police and rule.\n\nWhat's more impressive is that this was all achieved with just a few words and not much real action. While the VOPS is indeed increasing recruitment and operations, it has nowhere near the necessary numbers to put deep cover agents in every community throughout Equestria, but intercepted orders to nobody, post-hoc attributions, rumors spread by word of mouth, and the instinctual fear that anypony might be a changeling is proving to be just as effective, if not more so, than actually monitoring the entire nation with thousands of infiltrators. So long as we keep our true numbers hidden from the ponies, they will never be able to trust each other enough to resist us."

Personally, I don't think we are at the level of integrating them like this, but it's your call, so I made it available."/n/nJachs rubbed his chin. Bringing ponies into the higher levels of their own governance... Part of his mandate was to encourage this kind of thing, and for good reason. This would allow for easier communication between locals and his own organization, and would be a great look. The problem was, it would also be a substantial security risk, because it opened an even better way for the resistance to attack their new rulers, or even just for normal corruption to take hold.

He was once again in the throne room of the Canterlot Castle to visit the Queen. Some rulers had a summer palace, but it was as if she had a summer nation. Her insistence on using this city and this throne whenever possible was a fascination with Equestria that even Jachs found disconcerting. It was less funny still to the other monarchs. He reached the foot of her golden throne and bowed. "I am here as requested, Queen. What do you wish?"\n\n"Stand, Governor. I wish to talk about recent news concerning your exploits."\n\nJachs stood, feeling some concern. "Which part in particular?"\n\nChrysalis began furiously. "Your treatment of ponies! You doubtless recall that I chose you because I felt that you would be palatable to our new subjects. It was also a big risk for me, because your sympathies could have led you to act in their favor over Changelings. You have been doing just that! You have been consistent in holding back on them when they need to be punished and trusting them when they should be kept distant! The monarchs are claiming that you are turning this regime into one that chooses Equestrians over Changelings, and I have little to show them to prove otherwise!

The resistance fought back with surprising ferocity with all the traps and stolen weapons it could get, but such urban combat is something our soldiers had personal experience with from 1007. The resistance cell in Whinnyapolis has been annihilated, its survivors scattered to the winds, and our grip on the city is more secure than ever.\n\nHowever, the main objective of the operation, the capture of the resistance leader Trixie Lulamoon, ended in failure. The mare was able to evade our forces after a brief skirmish with panzer-soldiers at the main resistance hideout, inflicting numerous casualties in her escape. Though we have searched high and low for her, she is simply nowhere to be found, and has likely escaped the city by this point.

The sound of the blast was deafening, her bones shook and she choked on dirt.\n\nOnce she was out of the dust cloud and then a bit further away, she turned around and looked at the damage. A wall of rocks sat in the mouth of the tunnel, no queen in sight, and not much gunfire either. As a few of her allies ran up to make sure she was alright, she jumped for joy. She had killed the queen herself! A burst of rifle rounds cracked nearby, and she and her entourage cut celebrations short to retreat. The enemy retinue was still out in force. As she tried to create a shield to block the bullets, she realized that she couldn't feel her horn."

changelings_paxchrysalia.948.d:0 "Dozens of changelings and a few hired ponies were hard at work, clearing the tunnel as fast as possible. Captain Dieter stood nearby, taking witness reports and overseeing the excavation. Some of the digging was done with large construction machines, some with magic, some with bare hooves, as they tried to find their Queen. Her reckless assault had pulled her away from her guards before she got buried, so they only had a vague idea where she was. This was a mess with the power to bring down the entire nation if she was dead, and the fact that the rest of the fight had gone well wouldn't outweigh even a minor injury for such an important figure.\n\nOne of the workers called out, and the rest ran to him, shoveling and grabbing debris as fast as possible. Within a few minutes, a certain tall black Changeling Queen shakily stood from the pile of rubble. Greenish ichor dripped from small cracks in her horn. Dieter said nothing. He just stared with the annoyance of a thousand sunny glares.\n\nThe Queen walked up to him weakly, and tried to speak, but fell over from exhaustion. Medics rushed to her side to carry her away to where she could rest, and Dieter just stood there. In his mind, he wondered. His ideas on the military were exhausted. His ideas on politics were now considered an embarrassment to the nation. If she was going to obsolete his role as head of security by putting herself in stupid dangers, why was she keeping him around at all?"

changelings_paxchrysalia.49.d:0 "After considerable time and effort spent to carefully seed infiltrators throughout the Harmonic Resistance, the Heer and the Vhy worked in unison with the VOPS today to deliver a series of crushing blows to partisan forces throughout the Equestrian heartland and north-west. Information on partisan plans was passed along to the military, which coordinated assaults with VOPS infiltrators to rout and decimate resistance cells as they moved on their objectives. Targeted partisan cells found their safehouses stormed and raided, while ponies on sabotage and terror operations were met with prepared defenses and ambushes that cut through their ranks like a hot knife through butter. Within hours, much of the regional resistance network was in chaos and ruins, with isolated and confused partisan groups as of yet still fighting for their lives but dwindling in number as our forces close in on them.\n\nHowever, despite all our successes, the leaders of the Harmonic Resistance, two mares by the name of Trixie Lulamoon and Starlight Glimmer, have managed to escape the carnage. Their whereabouts are currently unknown, but it is thought that they were heading east to escape the reach of VOPS and Vesalipolis. Yet for all their effort, it matters little how far they run, for the Harmonic Resistance is in shambles and is unlikely to recover soon from this grievous blow. Today is a day to celebrate a job well done and applaud the excellent coordination between branches that made it possible."

changelings_paxchrysalia.50.d:0 "The Heer has been working in close coordination with VOPS in order to perform another large-scale anti-resistance sweep around Whinnyapolis, but it has run into issues that have ground the campaign to a halt.\n\nThe first issue is that the previous campaigns targeted the leadership and left survivors, who have since figured out a number of ways to defeat infiltration attempts. Comparing notes reveals that our operatives are pooling in low-level, low-importance areas away from the main groups, or being denied entry on suspect charges. Only a few operatives seem to have dodged the new security measures, and they are also having trouble making it up the ranks.\n\nThe second issue is that the resistance movements have started to infiltrate our organizations in larger numbers. This is being caught and handled often on our side, as well, but strange coincidences are making it clear that our security methods are not 100% effective just the same. Luckily, VOPS is a nightmare of paranoia and omnipotence, so they can be trusted to stay secure, although the Heer and other anti-resistance groups can not.\n\nThus, the current situation. Both sides are in a structural race of trying to out-infiltrate the other, where we both must dedicate substantial resources to continue the efforts at no gain simply so that our respective side is not the loser. And for the resistance, it's much cheaper to play."

changelings_paxchrysalia.51.d:0 ""What are we going to do?" Dieter sat limp in the chair opposite Jachs. They were in a meeting which was one they'd had a dozen times in the hopes of finding something new, but the problem remained the same. They had, through great cunning, gained a number of ways to try and kill Starlight Glimmer with the few agents in position, but whichever one they tried was their only guarenteed shot, and all of them were bad. She was too cautious for poison or a bomb, but anything else small enough to get next to her was small enough to not work by a large margin. Rumor abounded that Starlight had lost her magic somehow, but the VOPS thought it was a trap. "If only we had an archmage of our own, this wouldn't even be a question."\n\nJachs replied, "We'll just have to stick to the holding pattern. Keep up the policing, try and erode her support until we can get a better angle on her." Jachs didn't like it either.\n\nDieter gained some semblence of life. "I do have a suggestion about that. What if we figured out what kind of personality made a pony more rebellious? Then we could watch out for it, and catch the problem-causers before they start misbehaving."\n\nJachs turned to stare at the painting behind him. "Resistance is an economic problem. If we pre-emptively remove all the zealots without fixing the root cause, all we've done is delay the problem. This is an expensive idea, and I am obligated to mention that the ponies would hate it if they found out about it."\n\nDieter sighed. "I swear, these ponies have hearts of iron but stomachs of paper. Regardless, the extra breathing room would keep things under control for longer."\n\n"I wish it were so easy", Jachs continued, "But the Queen's coffers aren't bottomless. Going after your plan means making cuts somewhere else, and on something that might not work. Should we do it? Well...""

In Dieter's magic was a folder of graphs and charts, which he was flipping through. "I must say," he began, "I was surprised that I could come up with something new. I should have expected you to already have it planned, plotted, and deemed infeasible."\n\n"It's my job," Finicus replied. "I had psychological profiles by the thousand. It seemed like an obvious avenue. Have you seen the problem yet?"\n\nDieter skewed his head at one of the graphs, depicting a sort of bell coated in notes. "I have not. What stopped this from being put into practice?"\n\nFinicus began. "There are only a few personality traits that affect rebelliousness. Most are hard to spot. Narrow the field of view, and focus on the most productive rebels - the serial snipers,the organizers, the convincers - and that changes. Certain exceptional qualities become common. The issue - the most productive rebel is usually the most productive pony plus an unfortunate ideological conviction." He saw that Dieter wasn't getting it, so he brought an example. "The Vhy is new. Its officers are still drawn from the most exemplary. Those who rise to any challenge, always seem to have luck on their side, can perform minor miracles for the good of the group. The most effective rebel ponies are the same breed.\n\nIgnoring that Finicus had just called his loyal army "the same breed" as the ponies, he asked, "I get who you're talking about. What's the problem with just removing them?"\n\nFinicus glared at him. "Most exceptional ponies are currently not on our side. However, if they were all removed, neither side would have pony leaders, or masters, or heroes. We would be unable to replace them. Our occupied lands would become peaceful, but ungovernable. As the Minister of Economics, I cannot support that.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.53.d:0 "Major-General Jachs stood in the gardens of Canterlot Castle at the pre-arranged meeting place, and watched as a certain dissheveled, pale unicorn with a grey mane approached him. "Hey there", he said, "What's with the secrecy?"\n\nThe unicorn disapeared in a burst of green fire, revealing Captain Dieter. "We think there's some assassins trying to get me, because ponies never learn. What's your issue?" Jachs gave the manilla folder to Dieter, who flipped through it and recalled what it was. It was an order for promotion of one Glossus Sicarus. "Okay, what about it is concerning?" He asked. Glossus was being promoted to Kernil for political reasons, but was a perfectly capable officer of the Vhy. Potentially a bit too bold, but that was fine.\n\n"The amount of information." Jachs replied. "It's clear that much of it has been redacted for security reasons, and it makes me uncomfortable how much considering his alignment with the Vhy. Since he will be operating in my area, I have the right to get the full version."\n\nDieter cocked his head at him. "This level of security isn't abnormal. How long have you been trying to get any files at all on Lieutenant Alcippe?"\n\nJachs grimaced. "Yes, and that is annoying, but she seems fine. This still has the potential to be a big mess. Such rapid promotion means that he's probably an extraordinary figure, for better or for worse, and I need to know if any of it will make him a problem."\n\nDieter thought for a second. "Well, that's reasonable, but it's not easy for me to get that kind of thing released, either. It would be a good amount of time and a good amount of political back-and-forth on my part. On the other side, I know what is being hidden, and can tell you that it shouldn't be a big deal.""

Because it is a city with an unusual amount of Solarists, who see Celestia as a deity rather than a political leader, it has always been a hotbed of resistance of the Solarist variety, making it hard to pacify.\n\nRecently, it underwent a massed uprising. Luckily, on-site security forces knew that this was a possibility and had plans and resources in place, so it wouldn't have gone far. Unluckily, a newly-promoted Vhy Kernil named Glossus Sicarus was practicing maneuvers with his forces in the fields nearby.\n\nWhen he heard the news, he mobilized his army, decided that the entire city was a battleground and thus not under the Queen's occupation edicts, bullied the local commanders into letting him handle it, and promptly crushed the resistance, along with the rest of the town. City blocks were shelled apart by artillery and suburban areas had their doors kicked in and cleared. Entire neighborhoods had windows smashed by explosives and walls pockmarked with bullets. Much of the historic city has been reduced to ruins, and the amount of confirmed non-combatant casualties is still being tallied, but is already over a thousand.\n\nNews of the brutal suppression has caused a number of smaller revolts in nearby regions, many which are still being dealt with by local security. His fellow officers in the Heer are calling for demotion and/or expulsion, and even the Vhy has taken issue with his loose interpretation of the Queen's Word. When asked for a comment, Kernil Glossus said, "Well, I stopped it, didn't I?""

changelings_paxchrysalia.854.d:0 "De-classifying the full report had indeed been an endeavor. Even being distant from the political process, Jachs ended up obstructed when the "result" was a jumble of nonsense in two parts. That was when Jachs discovered that the pile of garbage files he recieved ages ago were keys for one-time pads, and he had to track down the cabinet he'd thrown them in.\n\nThe decoding itself was simple once he figured out the method. Convert the message-letters into numbers (1-29 for the changeling alphabet), do the same for the key-letters, subtract each set of key-message numbers, and convert the answer back to a letter for each. If the result was negative, add 29. Through that, he got instructions to decode the rest on a four-wheel Epsilon machine (!?) and a password to use for the task.\n\nAs he read through the full version, he realized that most of the new material was indeed perfectly normal and/or already obvious, and was just hidden so deep for dumb or shallow reasons.\n\nIt revealed, however, a few items of note that he did indeed need to know. Firstly is that Glossus was the officer who won the battle of Vanhoover by shooting artillery at refugees, an event which was still showing up on anti-Changeling posters to this day. That meant he was a possible target for partisans. Secondly is that he had bullied other officers into letting him take the lead on battles before. That was definitely necessary info. Jachs decided to have a note sent to all of the officers running the occupation that they should not listen to Kernil Glossus on matters of fighting resistance, even if he inisted."

It was an interesting problem that Trimmel loved, because it gave him something to do in his specialty besides plan for wars that he would be told to not start. \n\nThe issue was simple. A resistance 'formation' could appear nearly anywhere, hypothetically. Trimmel fought in lines, but now he had been tasked to organize the defense of an entire plane representing a good bit of the continent. Treating the entire map like a big front line didn't work, but if you looked at it as a series of battlefields, how did you determine where the fight was before it started? Trimmel had never dealt in planar strategy before. \n\nExcept he had. The front line wasn't a line, either. During the Great War, both sides had so many aerial units that the ground battle was just the biggest part of the fighting. The way you beat an incursion by Pegasi light infantry was by having your own fast units in the back lines to chase them away. So the front line WAS ALSO a plane. What if he just turned it on its side? Then he was on the ground, and his enemy was 'under the ground', sending their 'pegasi' up towards him to skirmish. In that scenario, his back-line reserves were... hovering in midair. \n\nHe began to draft a series of military experimental units, which called for a number of Jager brigades and as many of the long-deprecated Equestrian Air Warships as possible, with orders to strip them of their armaments to save weight for faster engines."

Preparing for the war was such an arduous endeavor that it left visible scars, with workmen being treated as inanimate parts in the machinery of industry. Victory meant an end. An end to the 80-hour work weeks, an end to the omnipresent threat of death, and above all, an end to the hunger. None knew what that would look like, only that it would be glorious.\n\nThis overwhelming joy found itself expressed in many ways. Riots broke out from celebrating hooligans and were left unchecked due to the police joining in. At the victory speech in Vesalipolis, an aged officer suffered cardiacs arrythmia from seeing what the rest of his family had died to create, and it was by sheer luck that he didn't become the final casualty. The Queens were split between elation at taking part, and disappointment that their life would be defined by servitude to Chrysalis. Prandialist groups baked Caramel Marks, cookies in the shape of the nation's currency, and celebrated the victory of the ethnic proletariat. The few remaining political dissidents breathed a sigh of relief that they would not get drafted.\n\nThe parties were endless, no military personnel could go without free drinks, and parades were formed anywhere where the local garrison was more than twelve soldiers.\n\nAcross the border, the elation was less universal. Ponies stayed indoors for fear that the barely-restrained crowds outside would assault them. Rowdy MP's robbed gas stations to drink the gasoline, and artillery batteries fired at nothing for fun all night long. In Canterlot, soldiers broke into a building to steal chairs, and discovered an underground debauchers' club, vandalizing the sign on the way out. The group complained to the Governor, who figured out the whole story and drunkenly declared that the new name was law. The "Cock Towel Society" was not entertained."

Attached is a complete list of the resources which shall be made available to this project (Project Living Space) from the Queen's accounts in order to facilitate this. Two cities have been chosen by Her Majesty as clear options, Vanhoover and Acornage.\n\n     Vanhoover is a true major city of Equestria. To make it a second center of naval projection would prove invaluable in the creation of a truly great Changeling Zehr. To produce a second naturalized major port on the opposite end of Olenia would grant a great boon to overseas trade. It would be a symbol of our nation's control over Equestria, a beacon of our nation's strength, a jewel in our nation's crown, and a truly majestic thing to create an enduring legacy from, all while producing a zone with superior fortification against a large-scale uprising due to its size and sea access.\n     Acornage is none of those things. It would, however, be cheaper and safer for this project. It should be noted that the granted budget is already substantial, and delays or problems will be unaffordable.\n\n     There being no clear superior option, Her Majesty has decided to let your administration make the choice, as you are the decreed expert in these matters.\n\n     So says Her Majesty, Queen Chrysalis."

With the aid of the Heer and the Wohnungsabteilung, the city of Acornage had been reshaped and molded into the sixth great hive of the Hegemony, and the results were nothing less than outstanding. Entire neighbourhoods had been leveled and rebuilt according to changeling sensibilities, and the call for settlers around the nation had been met with great enthusiasm, especially from within the ranks of the Heer, as the promises of free and spacious housing drew patriotic changelings to the city in droves. Not only that, but the relatively small size of Acornage made the deportation of ponies considered to be risky Equestrian loyalists simple and easy. The city was, by all appearances, a changeling city, a fact only further reinforced when Queen Chrysalis herself rode down the main street at the head of her triumphal parade and assumed official suzerainty over the hive as its queen.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect transformation, Jachs understood; it never could be. Moving half of the city's pony population into the countryside and replacing it with an equal number of changeling settlers would have been next to impossible. At the end of the day, the city was still somewhere around 75% pony, but that was a number Jachs was okay with. The pony population, mostly relegated to the position of second-class citiens, would provide more than enough Love for the changelings living there as to be self-sustaining, and the influx of soldier-settlers meant that there would only be an even more watchful eye kept on the partisan activities transpiring within its borders.

Did you really pull some strings to get a friend in?" Arcus said.\n\nJachs prepared to say what he had come to say. "Well, there's a reason why we brought in you specifically. We needed an officer for up north. You might remember that, in exchange for their cooperation during the war, we gave Stalliongrad to the Prandialists. Well, they've been getting uppity, so we need someone to keep them from rejoining civilization, and I brought you to the Heer's attention. I even got you no force limit to make the most out of your... history."\n\nArcus smiled cruelly. Prandialists had killed much of his family.

She exchanged a few greetings with some of the neighbors she'd come to know ever since moving into town a few months back, and stopped by Lily Lilac's fence to share a few bits of juicy gossip on the way. She loved getting to talk to Lily; the petite earth pony always had a way of making her laugh, and she always found out the most interesting things. But just as she was getting set to leave, Lily frowned and leaned a little closer to the fence. "Did you hear what happened to Carpenter's colt?"\n\n"No," Morning said, tilting her head in concern. "What happened?"\n\n"Carpenter caught him out late last night, after curfew," Lily answered. "He thinks the colt's trying to get in contact with the resistance. Stupid teenager. The buggers'll kill him if they find out!"\n\nMorning's face paled. "Oh no," she said, anxiously shuffling a hoof. "Do you think any know?"\n\n"Not yet," Lily said with a shake of her head. But then she narrowed her eyes at the house on the other side of the street. "But keep an eye out for the Rivers over there," she said. "They've been watching me do my yardwork the past few days. I think they're bug spies.""
CHN_event_67_variant_two_loc:0 "Morning Frost stepped out her front door and rocked back and forth on antsy hooves, feeling a nervous energy running through her body. What she'd seen and heard last night had left her both scared and filled with a righteous energy to strike back at the bugs that had taken her country from her. She doubted she'd ever be able to push the resistance leader's words out of her mind: the only way to take back Equestria was to make the bugs hurt at every step they took, until they had enough and pulled back. Even timberwolves knew not to stick their noses where it hurt; the changelings would learn that lesson in a few days.\n\n"Morning, Morning." The mare jumped at her name, but she soon calmed down when she realized it was just her elderly neighbor, Patches. The old stallion gave her a look as if he knew something was wrong, and he stepped closer to the fence that separated his property from hers. "Something on your mind, Morning? You were out late last night. I hope you're not getting involved in anything those hooligans are planning."\n\nDespite the elderly pony's kind demeanor, Morning Frost felt herself bristle. "They're not hooligans, Patches," she informed him, matter-of-factly. "They're the only ponies trying to make a difference out here. And I'm going to help them stick it to the bugs when they come through town in that big convoy of theirs tomorrow."\n\nPatches frowned at her. "Morning, you're getting caught up in things you'd be best off staying out of. You're going to get yourself killed, you hear?"\n\n"If I die fighting the bugs, then so be it," she said, scowling back at him. "Somepony's gotta be willing to lay down their lives to stop the bugs. And I know it isn't you.""

CHN_event_867_variant_one_loc:0 "Morning Frost frowned as Terracotta pointed his hoof at the passing changeling armored cars patrolling the market. "There's more and more of them everyday," the stallion growled. "And they stop you for anything. You look at 'em funny? That's a stop and frisk, and if you give lip? They're taking you to the station. Chisel said something to them a few days back, and nopony's seen him since. I bet the bugs got him. They had to."\n\n"But, like, they wouldn't kill him, would they?" Morning asked, anxiously crossing a foreleg over her chest. "He hasn't done anything wrong!"\n\n"Tell that to the bugs," Terracotta said, spitting onto the sidewalk as the last changeling car rolled past. "They don't care about us ponies. Not one bit. And they got their spies everywhere, so watch what you say. Especially around the Rivers."\n\n"Lily also said something about the Rivers," Morning Frost said, worrying her lip with her teeth. "Do you really think they're spies?"\n\n"Have to be," Terracotta said. "They just moved in a week ago, and they've already got that big house of theirs looking nice. Nopony gets any of the nice big houses, not since the bugs took over. But the bugs, on the other hoof..."\n\nTerracotta shook his head as the two ponies stood in silence by the edge of the road. "You get any... mail lately?" Terracotta finally asked.\n\n"No... why?" Frost asked him.\n\n"I did. Special discount at the farmer's market on Friday. Think I'm gonna... think I'm gonna check it out. You interested?"\n\nSomething about the way he said it made Morning's hair stand up on end, and his words clicked in her mind. "Terracotta... I... really don't think that's a good idea. Lots of ponies go to those discounts, you know? Somepony could get hurt, especially when the bugs find out."\n\n"Somepony's gotta go," Terracotta said with a harumph. "Might as well be me. You snooze, you lose, Morning. Sometimes you gotta just go out there yourself if you want things to get done.""
CHN_event_867_variant_two_loc:0 "After leaving Patches behind, Morning Frost spent the rest of the day tending to her garden behind her house, doing her best to put on some semblance of normalcy. It wouldn't be good to be acting shifty in case the bugs came patrolling down her street. But she just had to hold on for today, and then get ready to meet with the rest of the resistance at midnight to start planting bombs...\n\n"Afternoon, Frost," came a mare's voice, and Morning looked up to see Lily Lilac, a councilpony from before the bugs moved into town and disbanded the town council, leaning on her fence. "Beautiful day for planting flowers, isn't it?"\n\n"It's a beautiful day alright," Morning said. "It'd be even more beautiful if we could get rid of the damn bugs buzzing around."\n\nLily features slowly turned dour. "You're still worrying about the changelings?" she asked in a soft voice.\n\n"You aren't?" Morning asked, raising an eyebrow at her.\n\nLily shook her head. "I'm upset," she said, "but fighting and struggling isn't going to do anything except make this whole thing worse. Everything that the resistance does leads to changeling reprisals. You haven't forgotten that, have you?"\n\n"No, of course not. But we still have to do something! We can't just sit around here and let them beat us down forever!"\n\n"Some days, doing the best we can do may still fall short of what we would like to be able to do, but life isn't perfect on any front, and doing what we can with what we have is the most we should expect of ourselves or anypony else," Lily said. She hopped over the fence and put a hoof on Morning's shoulder. "What are they trying to get you to do, Morning?" she asked.\n\nMorning hesitated, but finally she sighed and bowed her head. "We were going to blow up the bridge over the river when the convoy went through tomorrow," she said. "Something to stick it to the bugs."\n\nLily slowly nodded. "Don't go," she urged Morning. "Radical action doesn't lead to anything except more violence and more death. But if we take a middle ground... maybe work things out peacefully with the changelings... things can be better for all of us.""

CHN_event_967_variant_one_loc:0 "Morning Frost sighed as she finally returned to her house and set her groceries on the kitchen table. The whole town just seemed so tense, especially her neighbors, her close friends she'd made since moving in. It seemed like every day, the changelings invested a heavier and heavier presence in the town, and more and more ponies were joining the ranks of the resistance. It felt like given enough time, everypony would choose a side in the conflict brewing behind closed doors.\n\nAfter taking some time to put away her groceries, Morning Frost went back to her bedroom and shut the door. She lay down on the bed, hooves rubbing tired eyes, and groaned as her spine decompressed. Her mind kept wandering back to what Terracotta and Lily had said. The Rivers seemed like such a nice couple. It was odd that her friends had immediately marked them as changeling spies. She felt a pang of remorse that the new couple was already ostracized from society and they'd only been in town a few days. And she couldn't do anything nice for them, lest even her friends think that she was a changeling sympathizer...\n\nThe alarm by her bedside rang again for three o'clock sharp. Grunting, Morning Frost stood up and reached under her bed, dragging out a suitcase. When she opened it, however, she was greeted by a mass of wires, a microphone, and an antenna. Propping it up and pointing the antenna toward her window, Morning Frost drew the curtains closed and shifted her weight from hoof to hoof as she waited for the signal to arrive.\n\n"Operative Frost, come in. It's time for your report."\n\nA flash of green magic, and Morning Frost's disguise fell away, revealing fangs and black chitin. "I'm here," she tiredly replied. "And I found out a couple of interesting things today.""
CHN_event_967_variant_two_loc:0 "The shooting started just before dawn, waking Morning Frost from her sleep. A staccato cacophony rang out over the town, coupled with distant screams and the thump of heavy munitions. But it was over almost as soon as it started, and it wasn't long before she saw the changeling vehicles rolling down the road, all intact save for a few fresh bullet holes added to the sheet metal here and there.\n\nWhen she went into town, the news of a failed partisan action was on everypony's lips. As luck would have it, a changeling patrol stumbled across the resistance as they were wiring explosives to the bridge across the river, and a fierce firefight broke out between the two sides. The partisans had been slaughtered almost to the last, and the few prisoners the changelings took certainly didn't have anything to look forward to. But thanks to the actions of the garrison, the bridge had been saved from destruction, and that meant the town could still trade with the rest of Equestria and the Hegemony. Life could continue as normal.\n\nWhen Morning Frost came home that afternoon, she shut the door behind her and slumped down against the wall. If it hadn't been for Lily Lilac's cautioning words, she would have been amongst the ponies massacred at the bridge. She'd narrowly escaped a brush with death and didn't know it until after the fact, and now she was grateful for her neighbors.\n\nForget the resistance. It was a doomed cause. But at least now, she'd escaped with her life. And maybe should could make a difference in another way, just as Lily had recommended, and make her neighborhood a peaceful and happy place in these troubling times."

changelings_paxchrysalia.68.d:0 "Cloud Chaser woke up exactly on time by habit. She dressed in her uniform, a pile of loose rags built for utility and cost above comfort (or lack thereof, luckily). She also brushed her teeth, combed her hair, and generally made herself presentable to her owners. Checking that, once again, her wings had not come unbound in the night, she left the "servant's quarters" guest bedroom and prepared for a new day of work.\n\nAs with every day, the first task was breakfast, traditionally some sort of mutton that made her ill to think about, but she didn't have to eat it. The house patriarch walked by, having creaked out of bed at some point. His morning coffee was obviously already done. He was the only member of the household who could speak Equestrian, a great boon since the house matriarch had no desire to do so and ponies can't speak Changeling. Him and Cloud were distant, as you might expect from an unwilling slave and her weary master, but the two couldn't hate each other. She had lost a brother and father in the war, and he... well, her main job was caring for his only child, who was his third child when the little grub was born. They both had better things to do.\n\nCloud took a second to rest. The Book said she had to be a certain amount of tired, but the house's two adult bugs worked so little to maintain their modest lifestyle that they often helped her with cooking, cleaning, and babysitting to stave off boredom. She gave some love to make up the difference. As a result, everything was just a little tiring.\n\nThe respect the changelings had for The Book was impressive. The Queen didn't want to pay to replace her property, so every slave came with a book that their owners were obligated to follow, and in the Changeling Lands, the Queen's Word was law and morality. The Book made her life hard and pointless, but safe.\n\nStanding up to put the rest of the meat away for later, she mentally counted. Nine years, ten months, and seventeen days to go."

changelings_paxchrysalia.69.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis sat on her throne in Vesalipolis, two booklets in front of her. They appeared to be scripts for some sort of stage play. Standing at the foot of her throne were Captain Dieter and Hivesmarschall Trimmel, who had each produced one of the booklets. Dieter spoke first. "My Queen, we have acquired a substantial amount of footage from the battlefields of the war. We believe that now is the perfect time to capitalize on our newfound reputation, and produce a movie out of it, in order to forever cement our military might as the greatest in history."\n\nThe Queen nodded. It seemed reasonable. "I suppose these are proposals for films we will make."\n\nTrimmel was next. "Not quite. My... colleague's... was written by a Vhy propaganda writer. If we want to make our army known as the greatest in history, we need something with a bit more 'art', or 'soul', hence why I produced a script of my own." It really was his, too – Trimmel was credited as the lead writer.\n\nDieter snapped back, "Your script is psychopathic and miscegenistic, not 'artful'."\n\nTrimmel's counter was interrupted by the Queen shouting "Enough! I will decide myself!"\n\nAs she flipped through them, the two scripts were indeed quite different. Dieter and the Vhy had created the Queen's Guard out of the most capable of the nation's fanatic nationalists, and they had done the same with their script. In all aspects, it was pro-Changeling, so much so that she wondered if non-Changelings would get anything out of it. Trimmel's offer was less skillful, but much more interesting. He had, after all, gotten his start by orating his way into warlordry. It was pro-military, but didn't distinguish which military. It would be more appealing to disparate audiences, but probably resonate less with the changelings themselves."

The rarely discussed ailment is portrayed not as a sign of weakness, but as the final burden that some soldiers must bear for their country.\nAlthough it received no official screenings in their regions, the film was seen by some ponies.

The contention comes from the film's treatment of the ponies: their soldiers are just as glorious as our own, but are betrayed by their officers. The climax, where the pony sergeant executes the lieutenant for cowardice and leads a suicide charge that wipes out both groups of main characters, cements that.\n    Oddly, the same split of opinions appears wherever the movie is shown.

changelings_paxchrysalia.70.d:0 ""They're wonderful, Jachs. Absolutely wonderful. I think we're finally heading in the right direction with these new officers."\n\nGeneralmajor Jachs smiled as he relaxed in his chair on the castle's balcony overlooking the rest of Canterlot below him. Sitting by his side was his good friend, General Arcus Venn, and between them was a piping hot pot of tea. For once, the two officers and friends had aligned their schedules to enjoy some afternoon tea together and simply talk about whatever came to mind. One such topic was the slow evolution of the Heer through the infusion of young blood beginning to climb its ranks. "The days of blitzkrieg and shock and awe are over with," Jachs said with a slow nod. "The officers of tomorrow have to dedicate their time to counterinsurgency and unconventional warfare. It pales compared to the glory of the Great War, but it is so much more important."\n\n"Indeed," Venn said. "Taking Equestria was the easy part, but keeping it is the hard part. I suppose you're to thank for helping us keep it. It seemed like you alone had the clout to stand up to all those sycophants in the Queen's Guard. They would have burned the nation down and called it a success because it killed a few ponies."\n\n"Oh, I was hardly alone. I had many good bugs working with me to make sure we pulled through." A knock on the open doorframe alerted the two generals to a visitor, and Jachs turned his head back to see an aide holding a piece of paper out to Arcus for him to sign. The general took it in his magic, scanned it over, then took the offered pen and scribbled his signature on it. When the aide disappeared, Jachs raised his eyebrow. "What was that about?"\n\n"Oh, that? Nothing glorious, like you were saying," Venn said with a small smirk. "That was a directive for expanding the armament of the pony collaborationists. It's about time we started getting some Equestrians to fall under our hoof and turn on their comrades."\n\nJachs nodded in thought. "Divide and conquer," he said. "We can't keep all of Equestria under control by ourselves, but if they're too busy fighting each other...""

changelings_paxchrysalia.71.d:0 "The cries of protest were deafening. The woefully undermanned battalion tasked with holding the crowd back from storming the Plaza of the Sun struggled to keep their fury contained. Generalmajor Jachs grimaced as he saw the cause of the crowd's ire hauled up to the gallows erected in the plaza: a young pony couple, each no more than 25 or 26 years old, cried and feebly fought against their executioners as the nooses were fitted around their necks. The executioner read their crimes to the crowd, that of harboring a resistance agent in their home for a few days, before the platform the two stood on collapsed at the pull of a lever. The crowd gasped as the two ponies fell with one last frightened cry, and somewhere, an older mare started weeping.\n\n"They're getting rowdy," Oberstleutnant Alcippe uncomfortably noted, pointing to the crowd. "We should disperse them."\n\n"Yes," Jachs dully said. He vaguely gesticulated with a hoof. "Use tear gas. That should be enough to get them to scatter. Arrest those that don't run."\n\nAlcippe wordlessly nodded and disappeared from the gallery, and within minutes, clouds of smoke began to rise amongst the protestors as ponies cried out and began to flee. Jachs passively watched it all, numb to the cries and wails.\n\nIt seemed like in no time at all, the chaos and misery attracted the changeling Jachs least wanted to see. Queen's Guard Captain Dieter Heinrich sat down in the gallery next to Jachs, grinning from ear to ear as the soldiers dragged ponies out into the plaza and forced them to kneel at the end of rifle barrels. "Lovely day, isn't it?" Heinrich said. "I just love listening to those pathetic equines bleat like sheep. Nothing gets me more ready for a long day enforcing the Queen's peace.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.871.d:0 ""Tear gas. It's a beautiful thing, isn't it?" Dieter remarked, gesturing to the obvious pain that the gassed ponies were in. "Just a whiff of it in your eyes or your nose, and you can't do anything for half an hour. Plus, it doesn't just kill ponies outright like mustard gas. Leaves plenty of opportunity to kick a few things out of them, or just enjoy the killing yourself. I'm thinking about appropriating it for the Heer. Our artillery corps could gas a hundred square kilometers in a short barrage with the right shells."\n\n"Tear gas is dishonourable," Jachs protested. "You know that, Dieter."\n\nDieter shrugged. "Who cares about honour? We're the champions of Equus, Jachs. What, are you getting a conscience now? What matters in war isn't how clean you keep your hooves, what matters is how fast you win and how many of them you kill. And, if you're fighting ponies, how much fun you have doing it."\n\nJachs watched the ponies being loaded into trucks in front of him, the effects of the tear gas finally beginning to wear off. They'd been defeated, but they'd hardly been broken. The gas attack only seemed to remind them that their only options were to revolt or die trying. They couldn't keep living under the brutalities the changelings inflicted on them every day. Sooner or later, Equestria would come to a breaking point, and there would be nothing the Heer could do to hold onto an entire nation in revolt. He wondered if he'd get a war tribunal at the end of it all to assess his guilt in terrorizing the ponies of Canterlot, or if he'd be lynched from the castle's tallest flagpole when Canterlot finally fell.\n\nJachs sighed and stood up, wanting to put as much distance between Dieter and himself as he could. "Do what you like, Dieter," he muttered. "I'm not interested in fighting you over this."\n\nHe could have stopped the Queen's Guard captain, he realized. He had enough leverage with the Heer and Queen Chrysalis herself to block Dieter's plans, if he just tried hard enough. But what was the point? Nothing would change. The ponies would still rise up, and eventually every officer in the Heer would be dead, punished for their crimes. Jachs had already let things get this far out of hoof. What was a little more cruelty at the end of the day?\n\nThe only thing on Jachs' mind as he returned to his office was the bottle of vodka in his desk. He pulled it out and broke the seal, putting the bottle directly to his lips. Maybe if he was lucky, the vodka would kill him before the ponies did."

changelings_paxchrysalia.72.d:0 "The billboard over the farm was the first thing Jachs noticed as his car came to a stop. Stepping out of the shiny black staff car, Jachs squinted at the billboard. 'SWEET APPLE ACRES', the sign read, placed above a grinning orange earth pony wrapping her forelegs around the shoulders of two famous changeling film actors, all three grinning from ear to ear. 'HOME TO THE SWEETEST FRUIT IN ALL THE HIVES; EACH APPLE PICKED WITH LOVE', read the message below it. Jachs frowned. Had one of the infamous Elements of Harmony really gone turncoat? He had to find out.\n\nHe thought back to the Great War as he made his way up toward the farmhouse at the top of the hill, his contingent of bodyguards staying close by his side. He had come across the Element Bearers once in the field during the Great War. Those damn ponies had rallied the soldiers under their command and repelled wave after wave of Jachs' veteran jaegers, refusing to yield a critical bridgehead until the Equestrian Army's retreat had been secured. They only finally retreated once Jachs managed to make the bridgehead a high priority target for the Luftwaffe, before bringing forward two companies of tanks to break through under a creeping artillery barrage. Out of all the engagements Jachs took part in during the Great War, that one had nearly broken him as a commander. The irony wasn't lost on him that now the end of the war had seemingly broken one of those mares and placed her squarely under his hoof as the administrator of central Equestria.\n\nPony laborers paused their work in the fields to watch Jachs as he approached, at least until their changeling overseers barked at them to get back to it. When Jachs looked up at the porch of the farmhouse, he saw the orange mare herself sitting in a rocking chair, watching the indentured servants labor hard in her fields. He wasn't sure how to feel about the sight. Hadn't this mare been the incarnation of honesty? Hadn't she been one of the most loyal ponies in all of Equestria? What was she doing suddenly supporting the changelings? Something about it twisted his gut the wrong way, but he couldn't put a name to the feeling.\n\nThe mare noticed Jachs approaching, and she stood up and donned her hat before trotting out to meet him. "Howdy, y'all, and welcome to Sweet Apple Acres!" she proclaimed, her voice dripping with hospitality. "Name's Applejack. Pleasure to meet you... erm, is it Oberstleutnant?" Applejack asked, sheepishly cocking her head to the side. "Forgive me, I ain't the best with the ranks of the Heer yet. I weren't the smartest of ponies, not that many of us are all that intelligent.""

I got fresh-pressed cider back in the house if you want some."\n\nApplejack emphatically nodded to her house, and Jachs waved a hoof for two of his bodyguards to enter first and inspect the premises. "In a minute, Miss Applejack," he said. He raised an eyebrow at her. "It is 'Miss', right? You aren't married?"\n\n"Married to my work, maybe," Applejack said with a laugh. "You don't get to be the biggest producer of fresh fruit in the Hegemony by sittin' 'round on your flank all day, enjoyin' your excesses. It was a bright and sunny day when the changelings moved in and took things over. Production's never been higher!"\n\nThat part was true, Jachs at least knew. He'd signed a few ordinances instructing changeling investors to devote funding to collaborationist industries in central Equestria, and Sweet Apple Acres had surprisingly been one of them. The simple orchards of the farm before the war had been expanded into massive plantations with on-site processing and shipping factories and warehouses. Applejack certainly profited massively from it, but would one of the former element bearers really turn that easily for money? "I know our regulations can be rather stringent," Jachs cautiously ventured, trying to bait out something from the pony renowned throughout the nation for her honesty. "Have they caused you too much trouble?"\n\n"Nope! Ain't had no problems in the slightest!" Applejack proudly proclaimed. "Sometimes you gotta be willin' to bend for the customer. The Hegemony is just my newest and largest customer."\n\n"And your workers?" Jachs asked, gesturing out toward the fields where the indentured servants labor. "Any problems with them?"\n\n"Only problem with 'em I have is they don't work hard enough." Applejack nod-nod-nodded along. "Production could be even better if I squeezed a little more out of 'em. Thankfully I got some loyal changelings to help enforce order 'round here. Now, about that cider? Perhaps a room for the night? It's the least I could do for you, Generalmajor."\n\nJachs regarded the grinning mare standing in front of him and fought hard not to scowl. He didn't know what he'd expected; perhaps some sense of defiance? But no, all he saw was a broken mare who'd bend over backwards if he asked her to. Whatever Applejack had been before the war, she wasn't anymore... and he didn't know whether he should be pleased or disappointed."

changelings_paxchrysalia.74.t:0 "Can Honesty Lie?"
changelings_paxchrysalia.74.d:0 "Jachs couldn't fall asleep that night. Something about the day's events bothered him. Applejack had been nothing but kind and courteous, perhaps a bit overly so, and had shown him nothing to leave him disappointed. The simple fact of the matter is that this larger than life figure, one of the six mares who had saved Equestria time and time again, had reduced herself to the perfect collaborationist, the perfect pony subject for the Hegemony. It was what any changeling would have wanted: a perfect figurehead of collaboration to show the rest of the rebellious populace. So why didn't it sit well with him?\n\nPerhaps it was all an act, Jachs thought to himself. Applejack had been surrounded by changeling soldiers and enforcers the whole day. Maybe she was just acting? But he frowned at the ceiling of the master bedroom he'd been placed in for the night. Could the element of honesty lie so convincingly? Could she betray her element like that? Maybe she was just a figurehead here, a puppet, and the changelings around the farm were the ones really in control. Jachs felt that he had to know, if only to answer the question nagging him and eating away at him from the inside.\n\nJachs slipped out of bed and opened his door. The bodyguard he'd posted outside of it jumped, obviously startled back to reality after dozing; at least nopony had come to try and kill him while he rested. "Stay here," Jachs ordered him. "I'll be right back.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.75.d:0 "Jachs saw Applejack sit bolt upright in the small bed in the guest room as soon as the door creaked open. Her eyes were wide and her breath ragged, before she blinked and looked around. As soon as she saw Jachs, she swallowed hard, put on a smile, and kicked off her blankets. "Generalmajor," she said in greeting. "What's botherin' you? Anythin' I can getcha?"\n\nRather than answering, Jachs stepped inside and slowly shut the door behind him, waiting until he heard the quiet click of the latch. Then, pulling a chair over from the corner of the room, he sat down backwards on it and rested his forehooves on the back. "Applejack," he slowly began, trying to carefully pick his words. "Why did you do it?" he finally asked her. "Why did you sacrifice everything you had to become..." He gestured around them, as if that explained it all. "To become this?"\n\nApplejack opened her mouth to spit out the same lines she'd been feeding him all day, but something in Jachs' eyes stopped her. Finally, after several long seconds to deliberate, she frowned at the officer instead of smiled. "I gotta protect these ponies," she said in a low voice. "I gotta do everythin' I can do to protect 'em. I fought against your kind for as long as I could to protect 'em. And that failed. Now I kiss your boots to protect 'em. Throwin' away my integrity, my element, my dignity? Ain't none of that was gonna help these ponies. But bein' your little toady, well, that was."\n\n"But why?" Jachs asked her. "I've heard rumors that your friends are fighting in the resistance against us. Why not join them? Why sacrifice all the intangibles you once held for a bunch of ponies you barely even know?"\n\n"Because there's more than one way to make a difference," Applejack said, her voice dropping to an almost inaudible level as her eyes fell to the floor. "It ain't all gotta be guns and glory. I'm doin' whatever I gotta do to protect ponies. 'Cause that's the Equestrian way." She looked at him. "I know changelings don't share the same morals as us ponies. You may have won the war, but we ain't lost, Generalmajor. Because we're willin' to do whatever it takes to protect each other. You consume and destroy. We provide and protect.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.76.d:0 ""Why do you wanna know so bad, Jachs?" Applejack asked him. "You wanna find out if I was bein' sincere or not? You wanna rip me away from these ponies for bein' a pony sympathizer? I can't help who I am. I can't help I'm an Equestrian through and through anymore than you can't help bein' a soldier for the bugs. And shoot, if I can't help but help ponies, then what's that mean for the two of us?"\n\nJachs was silent for a long while. Why did he want to know so badly? Why did Applejack's apparent subservience to the Hegemony bother him so much? But slowly, like the stars appearing in the dim light of a dying dusk, the thoughts began to connect themselves together. "I think I wanted to believe in something," Jachs said, his eyes not meeting Applejack's. "I think I wanted to know that some things are too sacred to collapse. Deep down inside, you're still a believer in harmony, and in Equestria. If we had managed to break you and turn you — honestly turn you — then I don't think I could have trusted any laws of nature in this world."\n\nHis gaze turned toward the open window, where the stars and the moon lit up the farmland outside. "It's... comforting to know, I think, that no matter how bad things get, there are ponies that won't surrender their ideals. No matter how evil this world gets, there are still those who try to do good. That, I think, means a lot to me."\n\n"And what about you, Generalmajor?" Applejack asked, eyebrow raised. "You tryin' to do good in this world your kind created?"\n\n"I... don't know," Jachs admitted. "I will never betray my country. I will do everything I can to maintain the Pax Chrysalia. But perhaps it doesn't have to be a world of tyranny and oppression. Maybe it can be one of cooperation for the good of both our species."\n\nHe stood up and pushed the chair back into the corner of the room. "Thank you, Applejack," he said, bowing his head toward the earth pony. "Carry on with your work. I will not bother you again."\n\nAnd then he left."

At 22:37 last night, enemy forces dressed in Wonderbolt uniforms and carrying heavy weapons attacked the facility, with intent to subdue the civilians and detonate the transformer banks with surplus explosives. In the engagement that ensued, DROPSPIDER and on-site security were unable to repell the enemy until after the dam was disabled. \n\nDROPSPIDER suffered 3 killed and 4 wounded, 1 unharmed. The enemy suffered a confirmed 2 killed and 5 wounded, with up to a dozen casualties unconfirmed, out of an estimated 30+ attackers. Security forces fled the scene after DROPSIDER became too depleted, and their casualties are still being tallied. Later efforts by Team LAUGHINGDOG would yield 7 additional confirmed kills while tracking down injured enemies post-repulsion. \n\nSo far, this attack has confirmed numerous theories through examination and witness testimony. Firstly, High Value Target RAINBOW is leading the attacks. Secondly, the attackers have wartime equipment and training, and all identified bodies are war veterans, mostly from Pegasi units. \n\nAt the time of writing, the dam is still out of comission. Repairs are estimated at two weeks. LAUGHINDOG is continuing with tracking, but does not predict further success."

Generalmajor Jachs at least had the foresight to bring paper, a clipboard, and a pencil with him; something about the vibe of the VOPS office made him uncomfortable asking anyling for anything, lest he somehow reveal some incriminating secret about himself that not even he was aware of. The only other thing inside of the blank room with its white walls and harsh lighting was Vaspier Orn Kladisium, the Great Imperial Nobody himself.\n\n"Generalmajor, welcome," Vaspier said, gesturing for Jachs to take a seat across from him. "I trust you are well?"\n\n"You don't know the answer to that already?" Jachs asked, taking the offered seat. "I assumed you have spies on my team to keep track of me anyway."\n\nVaspier's disarming smile was not, in fact, disarming.\n\nPushing aside the fact that VOPS was almost certainly spying on him, just like it was everyling else, Jachs tossed his clipboard onto the table in front of him and nodded to the tape player. "So? What's so important that you needed me to come down here personally."\n\n"A simple recording," Vaspier said. "A simple recording that warrants our attention."\n\nJachs frowned at the tape player. "What's it about?"\n\n"Patience, Generalmajor," Vaspier teased, starting the tape with his magic.

"Y-Yes, I am... erm..."\n\n"My rank is not important, Stabsarzt," the male voice said. "Now, tell us your story. You were present in Ponyville when the forest overran it?"\n\n"Yes, I was.

Thirty-three days passed between the fall of Ponyville and your subsequent recovery."\n\n"Oh... was it that short? It felt... it felt like it was longer..."\n\n"I'm sure in the extraordinary circumstances you found yourself in, Stabsarzt, it did. But you were only gone for thirty-three days. Thirty-three day in the most hostile environment known to changeling kind, I should remind you. Soldiers went into the Everfree all the time, and few returned. We need to know what you saw in there, and how you survived. Can you do that, Stabsarzt?"\n\n"I... y-yes, I think I can. It's just..."\n\n"Take your time. We'll begin when you're ready.""

There was a pause, and then Katydid continued. "The gunfire went on and on for hours. Me and the rest of the medical staff, we sheltered in place for as long as we could, hoping that the Heer could hold the forest off. They couldn't. Then the partisans showed up as the plundervines started ripping through everything, and they started shooting. Indiscriminately. It didn't matter that this was a hospital, they just wanted to kill everyling. Everyling! Don't they respect doctors? Don't they respect what we're trying to do?"\n\n"Ponies are a violent and despicable race," the interrogator said. There was a burst of static, as if he adjusted the microphone, and then his voice returned. "Please, continue. The hard part is behind you, save for this one last thing."\n\n"Okay... okay. Well, in the chaos, I got as many of the walking wounded on their hooves as I could, and we slipped out the back of the medical tent. But we got lost; none of the landmarks were the same after all the plants moved through. But we just wanted to get as far from the fighting as we could, so we picked a direction and ran.

Bit by bit, they picked us off, until it was me and another soldier. Hauptfeldwebel Vexel, I think. We got cornered by a manticore. He told me to run, but I... he was my last patient. I had to protect him! But what could I do against a manticore?!"\n\n"Your bravery is admirable," the interrogator's voice cut in. "What happened next?"\n\n"Well... I thought we were both done for, but then... this yellow pony, she flew up in front of the manticore. And she... stared at it, or something, and it backed down. I thought she was going to kill us or something, but she saved us! She took us back to her little home she'd made in the forest, gave us fresh bandages, and a place to stay... she helped us so much. Then she showed us the way out, but when we turned to thank her, she'd already disappeared. I never got her name..."\n\n"I see." There was an awkward cough, and then something clunked onto the table in the recording. "Thank you for that, Stabsarzt. That will be all."\n\n"Oh... thank you. So, am I free to go? I'm feeling much better."\n\nA pause, and then: "Yes, well, we'll see about that, Stabsarzt. But you should know, consorting with the partisans of the Everfree Forest is a serious crime.

And, given the overgrowth of the Everfree, it is unlikely that we will be able to mount a serious capture or assassination attempt on her."\n\n"So... why tell me?" Jachs asked. "If there's nothing we can do about it..."\n\n"You are the administrator for Canterlot and the surrounding area; the Everfree, overgrown as it is, falls under your jurisdiction. Thus, I felt it wise to inform you of this development, so you may be on the lookout for her presence, should she leave the forest." He stood up, and Jachs reflexively mirrored him. "Should she be seen away from the Everfree, please do let us know. We have plans in place for all of the Element Bearers. We just need them to be vulnerable before we execute them."\n\nJachs frowned. "All of the Element Bearers? None of them died during the war? How many survived?"\n\nVaspier only smiled politely and opened the door with his magic. "That will be all, Generalmajor. Oh, and try not to drink so much. Alcohol is good in moderation for relieving stress. In excess... well, you'd be setting a bad example for the rest of us."\n\n"I... I will try to keep that in mind, Vaspier," Jachs said. Then, shaken by Vaspier's comment, he quietly excused himself and slipped out the door."

changelings_paxchrysalia.87.t:0 "Nothing to See Here" ## Twilight 87-99 ##
changelings_paxchrysalia.87.d:0 "As Minister of Central Equestria, Jachs's rank within the government was high enough that his security clearance was virtually unlimited within his domain. It was, after all, HIS domain, organized to his wishes in order to rule as an arm of his own Queen. Just as Finicus's responsibilities as Minister of Economics gave him everything up to the power of summary execution in the performance of his duties, (contestable only by his peers or higher), so did Jachs'. Of course, in practice, this did not mean that nothing went on without his knowledge, just that it had to circumnavigate his entire power structure.\n\nWhich made it odd when one such endeavor wound up on his desk.\n\nA week ago, Captain Dieter had requested extra logistics for around two dozen Vhy guards to provide "security" for the Canterlot caves. Those caves had a limited amount of openings, most of which were in the lower levels of Jach's office-structure, so they didn't need more security. The better-defined reason for the request was completely absent. So it was denied. Now, Jachs was looking at the same request, with a heavy-handed appeal to his "national duty" and "the need for police repression of dissidents" which once again told him nothing useful. He was planning on denying it for a second time when he realized what was going on.\n\nThis was one of those secret projects that the Vhy was so fond of. There was something in the Canterlot caves that they're looking into, and because Dieter is not smart, he had decided to ask for more security directly and tactlessly, thus making it very suspicious and causing it to get kicked up to Jachs' desk.\n\nThe good news is that, whatever they were doing, it wasn't that bad. Since the caves were secure, he knew everything going in and coming out, and it was all above-board. The bad news is that, if he denied it here, it would get Chrysalis involved, and she might not be entertained by the whole scenario."

changelings_paxchrysalia.88.d:0 ""I can't believe it, but I'm starting to miss before the war. Back then I had free time!" Marsilio joked, drinking some Equestrian soda. He was in the cafeteria with Jachs, who's first response was something along the lines of "and I still had cousins", but he decided not to say it out loud. Lunchtime was the only time in his life it was socially acceptable to just talk, and he wouldn't spoil it. Marsilio continued. "Well, since I'm in town now, mind if I ask you something a bit above my pay grade, as it were?"\n\n"Depends on the question." Jachs responded.\n\n"Well, the blood for Project Michael – that's the one where we're trying to create a new changeling archmage – that comes from the caves under this city, right?" Marsilio looked at Jachs expectantly. "I could tell because the blood carried traces of crystal magic when we tested it. A kind of crystal we can only get from in those caves."\n\nJachs stared at him dubmly. "Marsilio, what in the Queen's name are you talking about?"\n\nThe minister was taken aback. "You don't know about Michael? Guess it leapfrogged past you. That's what that pony archmage you have locked in the Canterlot caves is for. We haven't had an archmage since Scleros the Learned three centuries ago, and since our own blood is just pony archmage blood diluted with magic water, we're using that pony's magical blood to try and create a new archmage lineage."\n\nJachs recalled back to Dieter's security request, which came back a third time with the Queen's royal seal and a story about a secret listening post. It was seeming like that explanation was a lie. "No, I've heard nothing of the sort about any of that. And I always doubted the Great Marsh could do something so worthwhile, anways."\n\nMarsilio took the joke and decided to focus on that, instead of the fact that he had accidentally divulged a huge amount of classified information accidentally."

His deferral of Dieter's request gave him time to investigate this Project Michael business himself before the proper amount of security was in place. He could figure out what the hell was going on in his caves fairly easily, considering the reported amount of current security being subpar. There was only the matter of doing it, which was a big problem. It was definitely possible, but it was also definitely violating the spirit of things, and the Queen was not one for legalist technicalities.\n\nBut at the same time, there was a pony down there, and a powerful one. It was not only his business to know, it was his duty. That pony was his subject! Getting too close to his populace aside, he couldn't just let a probably-innocent pony get drained by the Vhy in whatever exorbitant way those psycopaths were doing it simply because he himself was scared. That was not how he had been taught to look after his soldiers, and he wasn't going to lose the habit now.\n\nThe point was, no matter what he did, he had to make a decision one way or the other, to either take the leap and see what's going on or to just trust those in charge and forget the whole thing. And he hated putting himself at risk just as much as he hated letting a stranger be subjected to the Vhy's torture. And so he had been pacing for over an hour, even though it was long past his bedtime."

Queen Chysalis thanked him for being trusting, and apologized for Dieter's rude demands which were entirely within Jachs' purview to know fully about.\n\nWhat it also had was the missing explanation. Apparently, the labcoats had determined that the extensive systems of magical crystals could be used as a listening post to spy on other nation's atomic programs with extreme detail. It had a sister location in Soryth, and the reason Dieter had not thought to share this with Jachs is because it was an ultra-top-secret program.\n\nWith that resolved, Jachs felt a lot better about having let the request go through, especially since he had received a promise that such a miscommunication wouldn't happen again.\n\nIn truth, his biggest feeling was surprise. The Vhy normally did research around things like trying to find an entrance to the center of the planet, or creating magical portals, or some baffling uses for rockets. An actual sensor array with direct utility was more of a VOPS thing. He assumed there was some reason for this. Maybe it would have been revealed if Dieter had done his job properly the first time?"

changelings_paxchrysalia.91.d:0 "Major-General Jachs, the desk-pilot he was, was already seeing the flaw in his plan after the short wing-flight to the cave entrance on the upper southern Canterhorn. The sole guard, in a heavily-camouflaged observation post a short distance from the maw, was a Lieutenant who waved him down as he got close. If it seemed like overkill to have a Lieutenant guarding a cave entrance that never gets used, especially since she herself never did this kind of work except for this one moonless night, it had nothing at all to do with her being part of Jachs' command chain since before the war.\n\nHe landed near her and straightened his coat. It was not his dress coat, but a more practical attire, complete with a few bags of equipment. Best of all was a map. Ponies had loved the Canterlot caves, and they had mapped the entire thing densely to rescue trapped explorer-tourists and find the best material with ease. The Lieutenant saluted and said, "Don't do anything stupid." He saluted back, nodding, before venturing into the cave. It was a long way to go, and he only had one night.\n\nAs he passed the mouth, his eyes began to adjust to the darkness. The night sky hurt his eyes and made distant objects fuzzy and discolored, but the pitch-blackness of the stone tunnel was free from the influence of the Goddess Luna, and he had no trouble navigating it by sight, instinct, and map. It almost felt like home, bringing back memories of youthful visits to the central Hive-construction of Vraks. Compared to that glorious spire, his own headquarters was too planned-out, too perfect and mathematical and lacking in art, he decided. This cave was the opposite. His path down often took him up, around, or perfectly vertical. It was chaotic. It was natural. He had to put those thoughts out of his head as he approached the area where the Vhy's few nighttime guards patrolled. He couldn't be distracted."

changelings_paxchrysalia.92.t:0 "Metamorphosis"
changelings_paxchrysalia.92.d:0 "In ten hours, or a single one according to Jachs' watch, he entered the final chamber of his journey. His blood was still pumping from his encounter with the guard some time ago, even though in retrospect the overworked thing would never have thought to check Jachs' hiding spot. His concerns were only being put to rest by him being at the point of no return. There was no excuse to go back earlier yet empty-hooved now.\n\nThe chamber was large, with bright yellow crystals covering nearly half of it floor-to-ceiling. Aetherial mist drifted from the tips of the spikes into a bright yellow cocoon in the center that lit the room in stark shadows. Thin plastic cables fell from the thing, one filled with red and the other with IV fluid, and ran into a series of boxes. Consoles and machinery were scattered around the geode, powering and controlling the apparatus.\n\nIt took Jachs a while to gain the courage to touch any of it, in case one of the Vhy guards suddenly revealed himself from underneath the power supply and declared his adventure over. When he had spent too long just staring at it, working out what each button probably did, he finally swallowed his fear and stepped close. To turn the machine off was a single switch, the rest were to change settings. It was not even a large switch. Whatever was being held in the cocoon was clearly too dangerous to merit ceremony in keeping it locked away. An archmage would merit that. If they got out and were angry, who could stop them? It would take a small army. And Jachs was about to release this one intentionally. Point of no return, point of no return, point of no return...\n\nHe flipped the switch. The light in the room dimmed immensely as the forcefield fell and took the brightness of the crystals with it. A limp, skinny thing fell out, landing on the ground with a flat thump. Jachs looked closer at his new friend, saw a pair of wings, and regretted ever coming down here."

changelings_paxchrysalia.93.d:0 "Jachs fearfully eyed the thing before him. It was a unicorn, and it had wings. The horn had the most complex anti-magic device Jachs had ever seen, and every limb had some sort of metal cuff with a yellow gem embedded in it that was slowly glowing more faintly. What remained of its fur was purple, and there was a coloration of stars on its flank. Its Jachs was looking at Princess Twilight Sparkle, or at least what was left.\n\nThoughts were racing through his mind. Was it a trick? Was he just wrong? Princess Twilight had died abord the H.M.S. Amacitas en-route to New Mareland, hadn't she? Why didn't Dieter think he should know about this, hell, why didn't the Queen? And just what was he doing down here, anyways?\n\nPrincess Twilight stirred. Jachs jumped, and instincts took over. When she opened her reddened eyes and sat up, she found a changeling she'd never seen before, alone, in cave-crawling gear, saluting her perfectly. "At... ease?" She cautiously said. Jachs forced his arm down.\n\n"Sorry, ma'am, old habit." Jachs said sheepishly. "I was not expecting a Princess."\n\n"And I was not expecting to wake up to getting saluted by a changeling." Twilight propped herself up against a nearby crystal with great effort. "Ow. What's with that? Are you a Thoraxian they missed?"\n\nJachs' worry was replaced with indignation. "No, and don't suggest that again. I'm being polite because you're royalty, and we take that seriously."\n\nTwilight's brow furrowed. "From what I heard, your kind had nothing but disdain for Princess Celestia."\n\n"Of course we do," Jachs replied. "Princess Celestia is not royalty. She is a god. Her kind hates our kind, and we hate them back."\n\nTwilight thought for a minute. "That... explains a lot, actually." Jachs realized that he had yet to hear any hatred or malice in her voice, or taste it in her feelings. Only strain from her precarious health. She turned to him and asked, "What's your name?""

"You might know that ministers have ultimate power within their domains. Well, you're in my domain, and somehow I found out someone was here last week and found out you were still alive just now."\n\n"And you came down here, yourself, alone, because you just had to know what was going on in your domain?" Twilight chuckled, earning a slight glare from Jachs. "You know, if I wanted to spread harmony, someone with that level of care and attention is who I'd want."\n\n"I'm not going to betray my Queen, if that's what you're suggesting." Jachs replied with annoyance.\n\n"Not 'Harmony' with a capital H, Jachs. The thought itself. The one that makes you check up on a friend who you haven't seen in a while to make sure they're okay, the kind which makes ponies – or changelings – pick up litter even while alone in the woods. That's a good habit to get into." Twilight was smiling. "Honestly, I was worried that the same bugs who've been starving me for fun were the ones in charge up there."\n\nIgnoring the casual slur, Jachs changed the topic. "I should mention now that I can't get you out of here. You're in no position to walk, and I can't carry you."\n\nTwilight sighed. "I guessed. Well, I wouldn't want to undo whatever happened to give you some real power. Mind giving me some water before you put me back in?"" Jachs obliged her, and she drank from his canteen eagerly.

changelings_paxchrysalia.95.d:0 "Jachs didn't show up to work the next morning. He had come down with a mysterious sickness, and was taking the day off, and the instant he was done with the call he went back to bed. Spending all night cave-diving was not part of a complete sleep schedule. At least he got to have the second part of the day off to study.n\nWhen he returned to his office, he was greeted by Lieutenant Alcippe. She was usually cheerful, but once the two were alone, there was a slight dimming. In his cramped underground station, she closed the door behind them and asked, "So what were you doing the night you came down with that stuff?"\n\n"I'm not sure. I woke up fully-dressed, and my legs hurt like I'd been walking for hours, but I don't remember any of it. I think I sleptwalk all night and was just exhausted." It was not a good lie, but it covered all his bases unless he had been seen doing something which was already inherently incriminating. So, he added with a conspiratorial glance, "Truth be told, this job is getting to me more than I'd like to admit."\n\nAlcippe had stresses of her own, and could understand the effect that an even higher position would have. Still, she was his lieutenant. "Well, that's not good. If it becomes a habit, we'll have to do something about it. Is there anything I can do to help?"\n\n"Nothing that you don't already do, but if I think of anything else I'll say so." Jachs said. Alcippe was a good girl. It was a shame he didn't know if he could trust her with what he knew.\n\nAnd so the two went their separate ways, each tending to their position in the massive bureaucracy of the Central Equestrian region. Occupied by the rigors of his work and Princess Twilight Sparkle's words, he was in no position to notice that he was being watched by more of his co-workers than usual."

Then he took flight, and left her behind to finish her night of sitting at a post. His first stop was to get back to his house. His guards were easy to navigate past if you already knew their patrol like he did, which was how he had slipped out. Once he had gotten back in, he raced to a desk in a study that he nearly never used for lack of time. In one of the drawers were dossiers on every one of the Element-Bearers. He'd been following the updates, but never read the full versions.\n\nOnce he had found it from where it had gotten buried, he skimmed one, and then the next, and then the next. None of them had that critical line, "Her ideas can be found in so-and-so book published that year, find it at..." In fact, thinking back, there was no series of speeches or pamphlets or much of anything which described the harmonic principles outside of the Thoraxians, and who would want to be one of them? Was international Harmony really little more than imitating Celestia and these six young adults? He had had a taste of it, he needed more than that!\n\nHis last hope fell on Princess Twilight's journal, which was currently at a location somewhere between "unknown" and "classified".\n\nSo it looked like he was on his own."

He knew that he wanted to get Princess Twilight out from the caves she was being tortured in so that she could tell him more. Yet no matter how much time he spent thinking about the problem, there was no way to do that without revealing that he had committed high treason, and most of the ways to do it involved even more treason with an even lower chance of success.\n\nAnd so, all he could do was wait. Wait while someone who he might have been able to get on-side was brutalized under his own nose as if his title didn't matter. Wait until his Queen decided that he should be allowed to run his own responsibilities and let him know about the thing he should already know about. He only knew about it at all because Dieter Heinrich was chosen to do HIS job, and performed his duties with his characteristic brick-like grace. Why was he the one running the show at all? In this matter, the only thing Dieter had to offer was a guarantee of not complaining when given an order he should know better than to follow.\n\nJachs tore up the dozens of pages of theorycrafting and plots, and threw it all into the fireplace. There was nothing to be done for now, but that would change. He would remember how his Queen thought of him and his loyalty."

changelings_paxchrysalia.200.t:0 "How Long Is a Week?"
changelings_paxchrysalia.200.d:0 "Captain Dieter sat at Major-General Jach's desk. There was some sort of report in front of him, talking about a spate of Thestral crimes spilling into Canterlot's nicer districts. To Dieter's mind, the solution was simple, and he wrote, "Henceforth, any Thestral caught committing a violent crime is to become the property of the victim's household. Signed, Acting Minister Dieter Heinrich." Jach's job was a lot easier than it looked.\n\nSpeaking of which, he had just appeared in the door. "Hello, Major-General. How was the movie?" Dieter asked in his best cordial voice. Jachs had earned a vacation, and had used it to visit a friend who was making a comedy film. Apparently he had been allowed to direct a few scenes.\n\nJachs glared at Dieter. "It was nice, Captain, now what are you doing in my chair?"\n\nDieter explained, "Well, you left Alcippe in charge, but some business with the Queen forced her to vacate to Ponyville to help oversee something. Ministers Finicus and Marsilio are in Vesalipolis, your third-in-command is in the hospital, and your fourth-in-command is that far down for a reason, so she placed me in charge."\n\nJachs replied, "Well, that makes sense. You're off the hook. Now get out of my chair, I've got a load of debris to clean up." Dieter obliged. Jachs sat down after him, took one look at what the Captain had been working on, and threw it into the trash the instant he was out of the room.\n\nJust as he was getting comfortable to untangle whatever knot had tied itself in his administration, Dieter came back just to say, "I'll warn you, whatever is going on is beyond our comprehension as mere drones." So he thought Jachs couldn't understand it. That was either a good sign (Dieter didn't understand it because it was too clever), or a bad sign (Dieter didn't understand it because it made no sense)."

changelings_paxchrysalia.201.t:0 "Untanglement"
changelings_paxchrysalia.201.d:0 "The Major-General sat comfortable at his own desk in his own office once again, and after looking over only yesterday's paperwork, he was thoroughly cured of ever wanting to leave. Dieter had done a good enough job summarizing, collating, concatenating, all the things which were the busywork of the position. It was when he had to think that the problems came. Every decision he himself made was some new flavor of awful, usually being pointless, unacceptably bigoted, or both.\n\nJachs was lucky that sending out the forms had been reserved for the real governor's return. At least Dieter knew better than to use his three days of power to do anything.\n\nThe next step was figuring out where Alcippe was. This turned out to be easier than expected. Knowing the day she walked off wasn't as useful as it might seem, but the trail of paperwork detailing significant military hardware being sent to Ponyville for no clear reason (with the scale of the operation shrinking as he looked further back) gave him an idea.\n\nHis confirmation of the most recent request, a call for multiple batteries of lightning tanks, was actually a denial, along with a politely-worded demand for her to return to her office at once to explain herself. Truthfully, a call for that many lightning tanks would have been denied no matter what. The things weigh three digits of tons and are used to wipe out entire tank columns and city blocks in one shot. Even one was so expensive to field, and what possible use could she have for EIGHT? An angry skyscraper? Whatever it was, it was total nonsense, and he was disappointed in Alcippe for falling to it.\n\nImagine his shock when what he got back from the radiomail office was the same request for lightning tanks, confirmed by Queen Chrysalis's seal and signature."

changelings_paxchrysalia.202.t:0 "Chain of Command"
changelings_paxchrysalia.202.d:0 "After taking another six hours to unravel the mystery of the colossal amount of military hardware concentrated in Ponyville, Jachs found patient zero: a document that came in the day after he left requesting him to shift a trainload of explosives to Ponyville in order to destroy the Castle of Friendship, as well as requesting his presence to help smooth the process along. Alcippe, acting in his stead, went. Then requested a second trainload of explosives. Then a massive amount of artillery. Then a railway cannon. Then the eight lightning tanks, currently on their way because the Queen was also still there personally. Why? To visibly crush a symbol of Equestrian Resistance, which was the first Jachs had heard about it since the castle was barely a decade old and barely anyone had seen it. Dieter had been dumbly letting the orders go through, but even he could tell that this was a huge mess with no purpose.\n\nThe pinch was that this affair couldn't go on due to the immense cost in money and publicity. Jachs hadn't been reading the news to get away from politics for his vacation, but apparently the quest to blow up the castle was front-page news every day on every paper. This affair also couldn't stop because Queen Chrysalis was there to order it restarted.\n\nThat was why the order for lightning tanks had been quietly re-routed to somewhere completely different. He hoped that a bit of time to cool off and hear his version of things would let the Queen dissuade herself of whatever she had gotten into her head. All he had to do was wait for the notice that it didn't arrive, so he could bring up his concerns. This kind of thing was his domain for a reason.\n\nHis temporary secretary came in and left a note. Apparently, a recent order for lightning tanks had been sent to Ponyville, but ended up in some dead-end junction, and the local governor was checking in to inform Jachs that he'd corrected the clerical error."

changelings_paxchrysalia.203.d:0 "Jachs walked, grumbling, back to his office. On every side, ponies and changelings were selling newspapers depicting the impressive lightshow that had been given to the Castle of Friendship and left it unscathed. The next request from the Queen? An incredible amount of anti-fortification air-dropped ordinance. As in, he didn't know that they had that much.\n\nThat wasn't the only reason to sulk. He was coming back from a meeting with the regional organizer for the VOPS, an uncomfortable role with a uniquely uncomfortable changeling in it. Jachs had decided to try and call in the heavy-hitters to frustrate this ridiculous operation, and the VOPS seemed apolitical enough and yet powerful enough to influence it. He had planned to talk to their boss, but somehow couldn't figure out who it was, and to make matters worse, when he went to the local head, he said he didn't have the authority OR the desire to help circumvent the Queen's word. And probably reported the conversation as a sign of possible disloyalty. So it was a negative on all fronts.\n\nWhen he reached the Canterlot Castle basement, he slumped into his chair and stared at the ceiling. What to do? He was between a flood and a cave-in, with only one action he could take that led to no difference from if he had done nothing. His secretary came in and said, "Mister Jachs? There was a call for you from Queen Argynnis. She's waiting for you to get back to her."\n\n"Thank you," he replied before putting the receiver to his ear. As soon as he heard the click of his call being routed to Argynnis's personal phone, he started. "Hello, my-"\n\nA loud, tinny shriek came through the speaker. "MINSTER JACHS! I JUST GOT A REQUEST LABELLED "SHALL ACCEPT" FOR FIFTY-PERCENT OF OUR NATION'S BUNKER BUSTERS COMING FROM YOUR REGION, AND ALL I GET WHEN I ASK WHYYY YOU NEED THIS IS SOME BUILDING I'VE NEVER HEARD OF! WHAT ARE YOU CLOWNS DOING OVER THERE!?" Jachs smiled to himself."

changelings_paxchrysalia.204.t:0 "Meeting of the Minds"
changelings_paxchrysalia.204.d:0 "The Ponyville civilian airport was a relatively small and recent thing, being only barely paved. At least the runway was long enough for Queen Argynnis's private jet. It was a miracle of technology, and for a brief period, the largest jet plane on the continent, and the Queen of Vraks was proud of it. It made her security depressed, however, since every time she flew in it they would take bets to see if this was the one where the thing finally fell apart mid-air and killed her. Jachs thought it would be this flight, but no, apparently it was always that shaky.\n\nThe glory of stepping off the plane to meet Queen Chrysalis on the tarmac was dented by the aircraft's passenger compartment being only large enough for Argynnis and maybe two drones, but the tension was still palpable. Argynnis almost appeared as tall as Chrysalis from her indignation at being dragged out for this as she stopped in front of the supermonarch.\n\nChrysalis began, hiding her annoyance at the entire ordeal. "You didn't need to come all the way out for this. It's a media circus as-is."\n\nArgynnis was not entertained. "On the contrary, from the sound of it, you need someone to slap some sense into you face-to-face." Jachs stepped away to join Dieter off to the side, watching the spectacle. "I was reading about the Castle of Friendship on the way. Turns out there's nearly no real literature about it. Fancy that, for a major symbol of Equestria!"\n\nChrysalis tried to speak up, but Argynnis continued. "I found a lot of newspapers, though. And who did I see but Twilight Sparkle, sister of that dirty thing who's love thrashed you soundly in 1002? And the rest of the swine six too, who resisted you so heavily during the war and after?"\n\nChrysalis's hooves were digging into the dirt. She could kill Argynnis right now, but the fallout would be too much. "Wherever you're going with this, can you please hurry up?""

You are not getting so many of our hard-earned bombs to pursue whatever petty vendetta you've gotten embedded inside of you, and you will stop disrespecting your titles and acting like a child. That is all." Argynnis turned and walked back to her jet, nodding to the pilot to start spooling the engines up again.\n\nQueen Chrysalis stood, trying to hold back the rage. It was just lucky for her that, for safety reasons, very few were close enough to the tarmac to hear the exchange. She called to Argynnis, "So what do you say we do about the castle?"\n\nArgynnis shouted back over the whine of the jet engines, "I don't know! Throw a tarp over it, if you must! Minister Jachs, would you like me to take you back to Canterlot?"\n\n"No thank you, my Queen!" Jachs screamed forcefully. He was taking a car back. He turned to Queen Chrysalis and said, "I would like to go over a few plans to repurpose that castle. We have researchers who are stretching their leashes to try and figure it out, and the army would adore such a strong building to headquarter in..."\n\nChrysalis looked immensely disappointed. "Nothing could compare to seeing that tower of ponykind levelled."\n\n"Maybe so," Jachs offered, "but we're Changelings. Taking from other races and using for ourselves is our way, is it not?"\n\nThe Queen sighed, her pride appeased but not satiated. "You're right. Do whatever you feel is best." Jachs saluted, and went to track down Alcippe. He suddenly had a lot of work to do, arranging a research mission and moving the regional command center into the once-mothballed fortress of friendliness. Tedious work, but it would be nice to not have to worry about the damned thing anymore."

One of the science team got trapped in a hallway when a door locked itself behind him, we're going through food like crazy because meat spoils overnight no matter what we do, a sergeant threw up red blood out of nowhere, and a couple of the soldiers who were in the Everfree Crisis swear on their lives that they can see the Lady of the Forest watching them sleep."\n\nJachs took a second to groan and put his head in his hooves. This Castle was now his problem, and in the name of all was it making that known. "I can't believe this is my job. Alright, here's what you do. Spend another day in, then put up a lot of tarps so that the entire building is hidden. If anyone asks, the place is becoming classified, and nobody's allowed in or out except through secret passages, but don't be so obvious about it. Then slip out in the night, and make sure you aren't seen. That should evacuate the building without calling all the nonsense I had to deal with back"\n\n"Sir! Thank you, sir!" The telephone nearly shouted. "You have no idea how relieved I am to hear you not just telling us to push through it!"\n\n"Don't thank me, commander, thank the team of black-operations guys who will come in after you to make sure the place is as bad as you say it is. Because if they don't, this is getting treated as a truly dire case of insubordination. Are we clear?" Jachs heard silence on the line. Just when he thought the commander would reveal the deception, the answer he was hoping against arrived."

Settle down," Generalmajor Jachs instructed the sergeant. "Go take a walk, get a drink of water, and calm down. Your report is over." He nodded to a pair of soldiers standing by the door, who gently escorted the shell-shocked sergeant out of the conference room. Sighing, Jachs turned to the other officers seated around him: Oberstleutnant Alcippe, his indispensable right hoof; Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio, the Heer's surgeon general; and an assortment of local commanders from the central Equestria region. "The Hauptfeldwebel's report isn't an outlier," he said to them, tapping a plain folder sitting in front of him. "Many of you that have troops around the Everfree have reported back the same things, I'm sure. Attacks by pony insurgents wearing shamanistic paint and markings, who melt away like shadows into the undergrowth. An alarming increase in monster sightings around the Everfree; a reconnaissance plane even spotted a hydra." Picking up a sheaf of photographs, Jachs continued: "Furthermore, there have been raids by partisans who seem to be armed with unknown alchemical weapons." He spread the photographs across the table; one showed what had once been a changeling panzer, now a warped hunk of twisted metal. Another showed a changeling soldier sutured to the side of his burnt-out truck, chitin become steel where his carapace had fused with the door of the driver cab. "On top of all this, the tree line seems to be creeping forward at a frightening rate."\n\nOberstleutnant Alcippe nodded and provided some context. "Rail lines around the forest are being torn up by plundervines, and several of our scout posts have already been overrun with foliage. I'm not sure if you've ever seen anything like this, Generaloberstabsarzt?"\n\nMarsilio shook his head. "The Everfree Forest is a place of wild, untamed magic, opaque to even the greatest pony mages and scholars that lived near it," the surgeon general said. "We are fighting against magic that we do not understand. And I'm not sure if we'll win."\n\n"We will try," Jachs definitively stated. "It's the only thing we can do.""

Relentless pressure from the changeling Heer had brought the Everfree Forest to its knees, and with it, the Resistance's last bastion of safety. When he'd first fled into the forest to fight on Zecora's behalf, he thought that the indomitable forest on the outskirts of Ponyville would protect him from anything. Now, as the forest grew thick with smoke and ash, and the clattering of gunfire and thundering of artillery reverberated through the dead trees, he realized that all was lost, and the changelings were coming to wipe out the insurrection, once and for all.\n\nUp front, the resistance's heroic leader watched the destruction of the forest with pain in her eyes. In better times, she had made her home in its secluded depths. Now, her sanctuary — one of the last places in Equestria where the magic of the wilderness had remained untamed — had collapsed into cinders around her, and with it, the last vestiges of Free Equestria. Still, she bared her teeth and rubbed at her eyes, then turned to face the ponies gathered before her, tears streaming down her face. The fire behind her illuminated her like an angel of hellfire, and her bloodshot eyes burned through the smoke thickening the air.\n\n"Ponies of Equestria, this is not the end," she said, shaking her head, "for our actions, even the fates must commend. Our lands and our country are not yet lost, for their victory was bought at a terrible cost. Their armies battered us with monsters of steel, yet even now, we refuse to kneel. Perhaps Chrysalis was right, in that it was foolish to fight..."\n\nEverypony present watched as Zecora picked a rifle up off of the ground and brandished it into the air. Even though the changelings had taken from her her forest refuge, overwhelming the monstrous fauna and flora that protected it and called it home, she still had one tool left, in the crude form of a firearm. So long as she had something to fight with, then she was determined to fight. "But even though we may die, that does not mean we will not try!"\n\nWith a yell, her partisans raised their weapons and let out a war cry, Varnish among them. They all knew there was no surrendering now. The changelings would execute them as soon as they got their hooves on them. The only thing they could do now was fight, even though it would be their doom.\n\nThe final battle for the Everfree had begun."

Craggly, broken plundervines reached toward the sky, as if desperate that some heavenly figure would descend from above to save them before flamethrowers and napalm turned them to charcoal fossils. The skeleton of a hydra lay not too far away, the vertebrae in one neck crushed beneath the treads of a panzer. To the side, pony carcasses festered in a mass grave, the awful stench fouling up the air.\n\nFinicus looked up, where another wave of heavy bombers flew overhead, bomb bay doors open and ready to drop their payload. Day after day, night after night, the bombers flattened and burned the forest, working in conjunction with more artillery brought to bear on a single target than ever before. And if the industrialist opened his mouth and tasted the air, the faint tang of metal touched his tongue, the fallout from the magical nuke still floating gently on the winds, accompanied by a faint tinnitus whine caused by the residual radiation.\n\nSomehow, the Heer had done it. The Everfree Forest may have been a source of wild, untamed magic, but it had buckled underneath the weight of the changeling war machine like the ponies it tried to protect. In the end, magic couldn't stand up to modern military might. In the clash of sorcery versus steel, steel had won, and indominitably so. Now, naught would remain of the once awe-inspiring forest but bones and ash.\n\nIt was a shame it had to be this way. Who knew what the Hives could have learned given the chance to study the forest's wild magic and unique flora and fauna? What sort of advancements could have propelled the changeling species into the next era? Those were questions without answers now.\n\nAs the wind blew through the skeletal trees, their branches rattled like the bones of the dead, creating an eerie cacophony that settled over the land.\n\nIt was time to go."

changelings_paxchrysalia.402.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs stood on the balcony of Canterlot Castle and watched the headlights of truck after truck drive along the narrow, winding roads into Canterlot. It was an army on the retreat if there ever was one. If he looked just a bit further toward the southwest, he could see the fires in the Everfree Forest dwindling as the night wore on, the orange lights succumbing to the devouring darkness around them. He had already called off the bombers three hours ago, noting how futile any continued attempts to contain the Everfree were. It had simply grown too powerful and too large, and by now was far beyond the Heer's efforts to stop.\n\n"Generalmajor?" Oberstleutnant Alcippe stood by the archway leading back into the castle, concern written on her face. "Are you... okay?"\n\n"Yes," Jachs answered her. "At least for the moment. I don't know who our queen will pin the blame on for our failure to contain the Everfree, but whoever they are, they aren't long for this world."\n\nAlcippe anxiously bit her lip. "Well... it's not all bad news, Jachs," she said, slowly striding closer. "Our scouts say the forest has stopped expanding. Its magical energies must be growing too dilute to advance any further."\n\n"Or maybe it's just satisfied with its victory," Jachs said, shaking his head. "We've pulled out everyling we could, and we'll figure out where to redeploy them over the next few days. The heart of Equestria is lost to us now, forever. That's as troubling a sign as any."\n\n"Jachs?"\n\nJachs sighed. "Leave me be, Oberstleutnant," he said, defeated. "I'll be fine. I need time to think."\n\nAlcippe bowed her head, sad eyes trained on the general she so admired, utterly defeated by the onslaught of the forest. "Generalmajor...

changelings_paxchrysalia.403.d:0 "Oberpionier Mauric covered his ears just in time, a moment before the massive locomotive challenged the Everfree with an ear-splitting roar from its horn. The wartrain's advance seemed inexorable, the spearhead of the Heer as it thrust deeper and deeper into the forest. Protected by a regiment's worth of pioneers equipped with flamethrowers and armored bulldozers, the train's relentless advance felled the forest and the monsters that called it home with a cold efficiency, matched only by the brutality of the military police onboard the train; with whip, truncheon, and bayonet, they were responsible for ensuring that the ragged band of pony tracklayers at the front laid down crossties and rails past the point of exhaustion. Mauric had already passed by so many equine bodies that he'd become numb to the sight.\n\nIt wasn't an easy task for the Heer, not by a long shot. Sheltered by the forest and aided by the monsters lurking within, the partisans resisted every inch of the changeling thrust through a relentless onslaught of ambushes and raids. And as the wartrain and its entourage advanced deeper into the Everfree, the gulf between the changelings and the outside world grew ever more distant. The rearguard left to protect the miles of track suffered not only the depredations of the partisans and monsters, but from the Everfree itself; dozens of times the pioneers had been dispatched back down the line to carve a path through the resurgent foliage which had reclaimed the tracks.\n\nBut no matter what they threw at it, the train's thick armor plating and heavy artillery sent the forest and its denizens reeling after intense fighting. Still, it was slow going at best. Plundervines regularly erupted between the crossties, ensnaring the train's wheels until they were burnt away by flamethrowers, and the ambient magic and suffocating humidity regularly corroded and ruined the delicate electronics onboard the train. Runners had proven the most reliable way of communicating with the Heer, as the radios regularly stopped working a few hours after being delivered to the train. In spite of all this, the train's progress, slow and painful as it was, would not be stopped.\n\nA scout let out a whistle, and the soldiers around the train immediately rushed to their battle stations, crewing the ordnance mounted on the train's wagons against whatever the forest threw at them this time. Mauric himself quickly scurried aboard the train's armored cabins with the rest of the pioneers, hopefully out of harm's way. "Join the Pioneer Korps, they said, it'll be fine, they said," Mauric bitterly remarked to himself. "It's better than being on the front lines, they said.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.404.d:0 ""You think the Heer's all guns and glory, grub?" The grizzled veteran gives you a hollow look, his eyes seemingly sunken into his skull from countless nights of pressing his hooves to them and screaming. Half a dozen used shot glasses litter the bar in front of him, and those are only the ones the bartender hasn't swiped away yet. "You haven't seen anything. You don't know what you're getting into."\n\n"The Heer is the best way to make a name for yourself," you protest, trying to justify yourself before the drunken vet before you. "Besides, the war is over. All that's left is those partisans in the forest. How long could they possibly hold out?"\n\nThe ex-soldier lurches for you, strong hooves suddenly on your shoulders, pressing you into the seat of your stool. "Listen, grub," he growls. "I was stupid like you once, too. I won medals in the Great War. I stormed the palace in Canterlot. I was a member of the Jagdkommando-Einsatzgruppen. I had everything I wanted. Slaves, shekels, status. Everything." There's something in his eyes — a twinkle of nostalgia for the good old days, perhaps?—but it's gone in a split second. "Then I signed up for the Fernspäher, because what I had wasn't enough. And that's why they sent me straight into the middle of the Everfree.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.8404.d:0 ""Your worst nightmares come to life," the ex-jaeger growls. "You think the Everfree's just magical plants and a bunch of cultists attacking you at random? That's what I thought it would be at first. And that's nothing. Nothing. I could have dealt with that if it was just that. I'd been a part of too many ambushes by then for that to spook me. No, it's the other stuff. It's the other things that get to you."\n\nThe vet takes a moment to glare at the empty shot glass in front of him, and he signals to the bartender for another. It's there in moments, and the changeling wastes no time slipping it into his hoof and downing the liquor in one gulp. He coughs, grimaces, and before you can ask if he's alright, he fixes you with his haunted eyes again. "The trees, grub. They talk to you. They moan and wail when night falls. They've got faces on 'em, too. The night is filled with whispers and screams. They try to get you to do things, try to get you to kill your friends, to blow your own brains out. You sleep too close to one, and it'll strangle you with its roots, dragging you down into the mud without so much as a scream.\n\n"And then there's the timberwolves. Just wolves made out of wood, right? Well, wood doesn't feel pain, and it doesn't bleed. You need anti-tank rounds to kill one; bullets won't do the trick. And good luck getting enough fuel for a flamethrower when you're deep in the forest, isolated from the rest of your unit. About the only thing that kept me going was the contraband I could get my hooves on. I perfected the recipe for a nice cocktail of stimulants and tranquilizers made out of industrial-grade Love just to keep me going. It messed with my head, grub. I swear, I shot the same pony in the face dozens of times, but I could never kill her. To this day, I don't know if she was real or not.\n\nHe sadly glares one last time at you. "So if you want to live out those nightmares, go ahead. But if you do... don't listen to the trees. Don't listen to the damn trees, grub.""

She spied Marsilio sitting at his desk, nose deep in some reports and clacked her hooves together in a salute to get his attention. "Generaloberstabsarzt, you said you had reports for the Generalmajor?"\n\n"I did," Marsilio did, swiftly noticing that only Alcippe had entered. "Where is he?"\n\n"Getting much needed rest," Alcippe said, stifling a yawn of her own. "I figured I would take on some of the simple things for him while he sleeps, like catching up on some of his reports."\n\n"You sound like you need some rest of your own, Alcippe," Marsilio said. When Alcippe shook her head, he shrugged and gestured to the chair across from him. "Well, my team has made some progress since we last spoke on this matter," he said as Alcippe sat down. "The short version is that at the rate the Everfree is growing, we have maybe under two months to contain its spread before the Heer's position in central Equestria becomes untenable. We need to do something before then to contain the forest.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.8405.t:0 "60 Days to Midnight"
changelings_paxchrysalia.8405.d:0 ""The forest is growing outwards at a steady rate," Marsilio explained. He placed a map in front of Alcippe that marked the borders of the Everfree, and then ever-widening rings radiating out from it. "Plundervines are the first sign of its encroachment. These vines tear through roads, collapse bridges, and swallow towns whole. Then the trees move in, followed by the monsters and, inevitably, the partisans themselves. Not only that, but the forest is intensifying its inward growth. Soldiers and reconnaissance parties we're sending into the forest are suffering greater casualties, and many are simply going MIA within a few days. Swathes of forest that the Heer fells are almost fully regrown the following day; it's a constant effort just to keep the forest pushed back and to not lose any progress we gain. The more resources we commit to containing the forest, the more successful we are, but we are bleeding personnel and equipment at a staggering rate. We won't be able to keep this up for long."\n\n"So," Alcippe said, looking at the map between them. "What's the verdict, then? What should I tell Jachs when he's awake?"\n\n"Tell him that by my calculations we have just about two months to contain the forest," Marsilio said. "If it fully overruns the surrounding states, it will have grown too large and dense for us to hope to make any efforts in reversing its expansion. We will have to pull everything back and dig in around the perimeter just to make sure it doesn't overrun the entirety of Equestria. Right now, are military presence around the edges is slowing the growth, but eventually it will become too much to stop.""

Finicus bellowed, trotting up to Jachs' desk and dropping several folders over whatever papers the Generalmajor had been looking at until Finicus' arrival. "A huge mistake that's going to screw us both over!"\n\n"What are you doing here, Finicus?" Alcippe snapped, stepping forward to intercept the industrialist. "You didn't make an appointment to see the Generalmajor."\n\n"I didn't, because time was of the essence!" Finicus tapped the folders he tossed on Jachs' desk. "I heard that the Heer is planning on using Subject Omega as a defoliant to stop the growth of the Everfree. You plan on dropping the spores from low-flying crop dusters, right? After which they will grow into a moss that parasitizes all organic matter it touches, feeding and expanding on its host until it kills them both in a matter of hours. An ingenious approach to an unorthodox problem, if I do say so myself."\n\n"Yes," Jachs said, narrowing his eyes. "And how are we making a huge mistake? Proper precautions are being taken, and the land surrounding the forest is to be torched and cleared to make sure the moss doesn't grow where it shouldn't..."\n\n"But you're buying the weak stuff!" Finicus exclaimed. "The company that's supplying the spores for you? One of Dieter's cronies owns it. Our Queen's Guard captain pushed it over all the other competitors for the contract, even though it's the least refined. I should know, I was competing for that contract too."\n\n"Okay," Jachs said with a frown. "And you want me to use yours...?"\n\nFinicus emphatically nodded. "Yes," he said. "Mine grows faster, is more efficient, and most importantly, it doesn't overstay its welcome. That's the biggest problem with the strain your using. If left unchecked it could grow out of control.

As she watched, a trifecta of modified crop-dusters swooped over the Everfree, a green cloud billowing from the nozzles under their wings to fall and settle on the forest canopy below. She couldn't see where the spores made impact from where she stood, but closer to her station at the Heer field hospital, she could see the bone-white husks of trees where the moss had landed, feasted, and subsequently died out. Little by little, the Heer's latest plan to beat back the encroaching forest seemed to find success, and the efforts had dramatically slowed the ability of the forest to press outwards toward the concrete-lined ditch the Heer had hastily erected around it.\n\nBut the price those efforts demanded could be horrid. In a steady deluge, ponies and changelings who had fallen victim to the spores had been brought back to her hospital, the former often civilians caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, the latter members of the Fernspäher operating deep within the Everfree. The moss didn't limit itself to plants; it went after anything organic, and ponies and changelings alike whimpered in agony as the moss ate into their flesh. Most had no chance for survival. Once the moss made it into a creature's bloodstream, they would wither and die from the inside out as the moss feasted upon their organs. All Katydid could do was prepare a triple-dose of morphine to ease their pain on the way out. It put a terrible toll on her mind, and her fears weren't eased when one of the orderlies under her command started coughing and fell ill as the spores infected him as well.\n\nHer brief moment of introspection over, her face resumed its usual impassive mask of stoicism, and Stabsarzt Katydid turned back to her work as the noise of the planes died away.

changelings_paxchrysalia.409.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]It appears today that the Changeling Hegemony has detonated a thaumato-nuclear device at the epicenter of the infamous Everfree Forest, situated in central Equus. This does not seem to have been a test, as the chosen location would make the observation of a nuclear weapon difficult to perform. Rather, this looks to have been a military response to the ongoing insurgency originating from the Everfree Forest, whilst other sources suggest that the detonation was intended as a particularly extravagant means of defoliation to combat the Everfree's supernatural, exponential growth spurt that threatens to engulf the Royal Changeling Heer's holdings in the region. Though the Great War is over, Equestria itself is far from pacified, if this recent development is any indication of the Hegemony's determination — or desperation — to continue their imperial rule over Equus."

"I'm trying to do my damnedest to stop the spread of the Everfree, but it feels like every single changeling in the Hegemony is trying to tell me what to do."\n\nFinicus rolled his eyes and passed the letter back to Jachs. "My colleagues got wind of your new plan for the Everfree. What was it, to bomb the thing with napalm every hour of every day for two weeks straight?"\n\n"In its simplest interpretation, yes," Jachs said. "Precision bombing runs during the first week establish a perimeter of fire, which, fueled by a recirculatory jet stream created through weather manipulation, will make it self-sustaining. Then, it'll be indiscriminate saturation bombardment to create a firestorm, until the whole thing is sticks and cinders. But now I'm being told to scale back the bombing in this letter signed by all of your friends."\n\nFinicus drew a sheaf of papers from his briefcase with a flourish. "You must know of the star-spiders. I hear they account for a whole two percent of soldier casualties in the Everfree." Seeing the Generalmajor's frown deepen, Finicus pressed on. "What I don't expect you to know, though, is how valuable an asset we think they will be to future scientific developments. More specifically, their silk. I believe that even the new Panther models have trouble disentangling from the webs." "Get to the point," Jachs snapped.\n\n"My point is that the Everfree is potentially the single most significant source of untapped natural resources in all of Equus. Star-spider silk only scratches the surface of what we could accomplish from using the sort of stuff the Everfree has to offer. And now you say you want to firebomb all that potential into ashes and dust."\n\n"Tough times call for tough measures," Jachs all but snarled. "My job is to stop the Everfree — let me remind you, it's the gods-damned Everfree we're talking about here — from overrunning all of central Equestria, and all you can talk about is how it'll hurt your profit margins.""

It was four in the morning, and every hour for the last few days, another wing of changeling bombers would fly over Ponyville on their way to the Everfree. Every single time she heard that drone from their engines, her heart leapt into her throat, as traumatic memories of changeling bombers flattening the town during the Great War resurfaced to the front of her mind. At least with the nerve-wracking regularity of the bombardment, she was starting to get used to it...\n\nBut that didn't help her at all when she was trying to sleep. She poked her head out from beneath her pillow and glared at the drawn blackout curtains in the corner of her room. The firestorm raging in the heart of the Everfree was so great that its apocalyptic flames cast their orange glow all the way to Ponyville, painting her room in shades of amber, despite the fact that Roseluck had done her best to coat the cloth in black paint and stop any light from getting in. She knew come morning she'd have to spend hours shovelling ash out of her walkway, and then she'd have to do it again before going to bed tomorrow night. Between the shovelling, the lack of sleep, and the suffocating orange haze that blanketed Ponyville, Roseluck almost wished that one of those bombers would empty their payload on her house and put her out of her misery.\n\nAlmost."

Before she could slip into cover, Vexel fired his weapon, the shot ripping through the pony's neck and leaving her drowning in her own blood on the ground. Retaliatory gunfire from the rest of the partisans further up the street barraged his position, and the sergeant slid down deeper into his foxhole.\n\nBeside him was Oberleutnant Cisiphus, her officer's cap lost somewhere in the fighting around Ponyville. She held a radio's headset to the side of her head, her fangs reflecting the orange fires burning around the town as she screamed into it. "What do you mean there's no artillery?! You were supposed to keep the plundervines away from the guns! That's what the concrete emplacements were for!"\n\nA roar went up through the town, and dirt fell down into the foxhole as an ursa minor leapt over it, its starry claws flattening the halftrack that had been providing Vexel and the Oberleutnant fire support. The ground trembled underhoof as the ursa minor continued its rampage, and as changeling soldiers fled down the street in a panicked rout, Vexel realized their lines were breaking and they'd soon be overrun. Gritting his teeth, Vexel scurried over to Cisiphus and grabbed her by the shoulder. "Oberleutnant, we need to fall back! Our lines are breaking, and if we don't move—!"\n\n"I will not surrender Ponyville to a bunch of plants!" Cisiphus shouted back. "I will not be known as the officer who lost Ponyville! I will not surrender to the forest! I will fight to the bitter end if I have to! All we need to do is hold out until the bombers arri—!"\n\nShe never got the chance to finish, as the ground suddenly exploded around her, tossing Vexel backwards. The sergeant came to a rest upside down on the far end of the foxhole, and from the ground where the Oberleutnant once stood, he saw, spewing forth into the sky like a geyser, a glistening purple tube thicker than a tree trunk, topped with a snakelike head that split open, as if it were a flower in bloom, into a troika of petals dotted with slitted eyes. Still propelling itself skywards, the eyes on the tatzlwurm's petals stared down at the fleeing soldiers below with a brutish, inequine malice. The thing let out a horrendous screech as it lashed at the formation of Luftwaffe fighters circling the town from above, ensnaring a trio of Stukas with its whiplike tongues and dashing them on the rooftops below with a powerful flex of its body. Of the lieutenant, nothing remained save for her radio.\n\nWith the grisly demise of their commanding officer, what was left of the Heer in Ponyville soon broke ranks and fled, the partisans of the Everfree and their monstrous allies hot on their heels."

His eyes wandered from Oberstleutnant Alcippe to Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio and finally onto the industrialist, Finicus Vesali. "What happened? How do we explain ourselves to Chrysalis?"\n\n"We used the wrong type of moss," Finicus said. "It was wildly ineffective at limiting the growth of the forest. It didn't do enough to stop the spread. We should have used mine."\n\n"The target we chose for the anti-thaumatic nuclear device was incorrect," Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio stated. "Instead of hitting the hotspot of the resistance, we targeted a random patch of forest to save the Castle of the Two Sisters."\n\n"We compromised on the firebombing strategy to appease the capitalists," Alcippe said with a pointed glance at Finicus. "We tried to limit our damage so they could get something of value out of it."\n\nJachs frowned as he heard the list of failures laid out before him. "We had a plan at the start of this," he began, "and we compromised at every point. We used the weakest strain of moss. We attacked the wrong location in the Everfree. And then, to top it all off, we barely pressed our attack on the forest after doing almost nothing to weaken it." He sighed and leaned back in his chair, rubbing his eyes. "We half-heartedly attacked the Everfree, and it laughed off everything we threw at it. Honestly speaking? We deserve the current mess we're in. We deserve it and so much more.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.414.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs, Captain Dieter Heinrich, and the director of the VOPS, Vaspier Orn Kladisium, all bowed low as Queen Chrysalis swept into the meeting room at Canterlot Castle. Chrysalis paid them little mind as she immediately strode over to the table and placed her hooves on the edge, grinning from ear to ear. "The Everfree is no more," she proudly proclaimed. "Reduced to little more than charred sticks and scorched stones. Excellent work, Generalmajor. I always knew I could count on you."\n\nJachs humbly dipped his head. "Thank you, your Majesty."\n\n"Now," Chrysalis began, "what of the witch herself? What of this zebra that's been causing us so many problems?"\n\n"My best and bravest spies have carefully confirmed that the zebra shamaness known as Zecora is still alive and at large within the Everfree," Vaspier said, lighting a cigarette and putting it between his lips. "Her partisan movement has been utterly decimated, but she still has a ragtag band of survivors with her. There's hardly any forest left for her to hide in. Sooner or later, her time will come."\n\n"So let's flush her out, then!" Dieter exclaimed. "Now's our chance to deliver the coup de grâce to that foul witch. With the forest no longer a threat, how much longer can she hide?"\n\n"I've mobilized a dedicated task force to scour the Everfree by land and air," Jachs said, pushing a file toward the center of the table. "All we need is your word, your Majesty, and we will begin."\n\nChrysalis thought for a moment, then grinned even wider. "I should hunt the zebra personally," she proclaimed. "It would only be fitting for the greatest of the changeling Queens to bring back the head of the zebra that has caused us so much trouble!"\n\nAt once, all three underlings shared a look of concern. "Pardon my imprudence, your Majesty," Vaspier said. "But the Everfree is no place for a Queen to be. I'm sure the task force will be capable of leading itself. If anything were to happen to you...""

changelings_paxchrysalia.415.d:0 "Deep in the recesses of the forest, the hunters were afraid. Setting up camp where the undergrowth was naught but soot and ashes, they huddled around unlit campfires — for there was no foliage to serve as fuel — and told each other stories of the monsters that still lurked within the dark.\n\nFearful of the forest as they were, the soldiers of the Fernspäher took pride in the extraordinary nature of their service, for only the best of the best could delve deep into the Everfree and return. They'd survived bugbears and parasprites, and the depredation of the forest's partisans, but even with the Everfree scorched and atrophied, its most infamous denizen remained uncowed and at large.\n\nZecora the witch, who went into battle with her face hidden behind a shamanistic mask, or who could change bodies like any changeling shapeshifter, or whose visage no soldier of the Heer had ever laid eyes upon and lived to tell the tale. The partisans who painted themselves in their rudimentary, esoteric camouflage paid homage to their leader in their evocation of zebrican tribal markings. It was her who the changelings hunted and feared.\n\nThey recounted to each other hearsay of what had befallen their fellow hunters, recalling the snippets of information that eluded the attention of the censors and propagandists. They drank toasts to fallen brothers-in-arms; Major Pugnax, eponymous leader of his doomed Kampfgruppe, whose ossified form was found sticking out of the cupola of his tank, having been petrified by the same witchcraft that turned his soldiers to stone; or the three-dozen Fallschirmjaegers who'd been dropped over the heart of the forest, disappearing beneath the tree canopy at the nadir of their descent to be swallowed up apiece by the forest. A patrol found their bodies days later, the entire platoon hanging from a grove of trees by their parachute straps, which had been fashioned into makeshift nooses.\n\nThe changeling commanders in Canterlot read the reports that trickled in from the hunters who'd survived their forays into the forest, returning battered and empty-hooved, and more often than not marred by traumas both within and without. When it became clear that the Heer would not be able to track down the witch, the reports were filed away to be quietly forgotten about, the hunters reassigned to other, less dangerous postings, and the zebra expunged from all official records; after all, what didn't exist couldn't be a threat."

changelings_paxchrysalia.416.d:0 "The Everfree was no match for the magic of the Great Queen of the Changelings. Her strength amplified from the imbibement of freshly harvested Love, Queen Chrysalis hacked a swath of destruction through the diseased heart of the Everfree, supported by a task force of the Heer's best and brightest. With Chrysalis as its vanguard, the changeling hunters had little difficulty penetrating the ragged and burnt-out foliage to reach the last bastion, where the zebra witch herself still hid.\n\nA hailstorm of gunfire erupted from the partisans as Chrysalis burst into the clearing, but an ethereal shield protected herself and the bodyguards immediately at her sides. Baying like bloodhounds, the changelings burst into the clearing, eager to set upon the smattering of weary and exhausted partisans that had somehow managed to survive the onslaught of the Heer. It wasn't even a fair fight; it was more akin to target practice, with the ponies falling to bullet and bayonet as their defenses were quickly overrun.\n\n"Show yourself, witch!" Chrysalis roared, ripping apart tent after tent and flinging the debris every which way. "Surrender to me, and I might let you live. Or don't; that might make it more fun." She closed her eyes and turned her nose skyward, drawing in a deep breath to cast a spell. Then, grinning, she turned toward the far corner of the forest and stalked closer like a cat pursuing a cornered mouse. "I can taste your fear, zebra, and it tastes delicious..."\n\nHer magic seized ahold of the unassuming tent and tore the fabric in two..."

changelings_paxchrysalia.8416.d:0 "There in the remains of the tent was the zebra herself. She was a pitiful sight. Black ash smeared the lines between her stripes, her green tribal paint was all but worn away, and burns covered her face, her neck, and her front legs. A sling held her foreleg close to her chest, and her eyes were bloodshot with fever. She'd survived the Heer's efforts to destroy the Everfree, but only barely by the looks of it.\n\n"There you are," Chrysalis purred, her magic seizing Zecora by the throat and pulling her out of the tent. The zebra coughed and struggled, but she was too weak to put up a fight. "How the mighty have fallen," Chrysalis taunted her. "You've been a pain in my side for too long, you realize? But now I finally have you."\n\n"You think... you have me?" the zebra choked out through Chrysalis' grip. "But perhaps... you should wait and see!"\n\nHer hoof lashed out at Chrysalis' horn, and the changeling queen dropped Zecora at the sudden pain. Chrysalis' bodyguards leapt into action, but Zecora struck her hoof against the ground, and a wall of plundervines burst forth to cut them off from their queen. It was just Zecora and Chrysalis now, and Chrysalis bared her fangs at the zebra. "You cur! I'll have your head!"\n\nShe moved to advance on Zecora, but fast as lightning, Zecora snatched a vial of a blue liquid from her sling and hurled it at Chrysalis. The glass broke on her face and the liquid hissed as it burned through Chrysalis' chitin, leaving the changeling queen howling in pain. Then, Zecora began to chant in a haunting voice:"

Her face felt like it was melting, the chitin plates cracking and drooping as what was in the vial worked its foul magic on them. Gritting her teeth, Zecora spat on the ground before turning tail and fleeing deeper into the deepest, darkest heart of the Everfree, the bastion that had remained untouched and resilient no matter what the Heer had thrown at it. The forest seemed to close in after her, trees moving closer together and branches interlocking to form an impenetrable wall.\n\nIt took almost an hour before the jaegers were able to break through the plundervines and reach their queen. In that time, she had fallen unconscious, and nervous whispers passed through their ranks as they called for a medic."

"I am trying, you useless lout," she snapped at him. Baring her teeth in frustration, Chrysalis placed her hooves to her face, trying to summon the magic that had been so natural to her all her life.\n\n"D-do be careful, your Majesty. The surgeons went to great lengths to repair your face. Too much pressure and you might damage the chitin..."\n\nChrysalis wanted to scream at him, but didn't see the point. It'd taken all the best surgeons in the Hives to fix her face, or at least get it to resemble something like her old self, after that damned zebra cursed it with the poison joke in that vial. But none had been able to fix the real curse placed on her, and that bothered her more than looks ever did. Mostly, because she couldn't change hers anymore.\n\nStill, she did as the doctor asked, and she felt the surge of magic within her erupt in a ring of green fire around where she sat. The pretty pink form of Princess Cadance sat in the mirror, almost perfect... but it wasn't. Her horn was a touch too long, her eyes the wrong shade of blue, even the gradient of the purple on her wings was off! "Why won't it work?!" Chrysalis howled through Cadance's voice. "It's not perfect! It's not right!"\n\nThe doctor cautiously scribbled a few things into his clipboard and tried to give his queen a reassuring smile. "But your M-majesty... it is p-perfect. This looks exactly like Princess Cadance, just like when you infiltrated the royal wedding in Canterlot." He hesitated, then added, "Your Majesty... perhaps Zecora's so-called "curse" has taken a toll on your mind, not your powers. The witch has tricked you into thinking your transformations aren't perfect when, in fact, they are flawless imitations, just as they always have been."\n\nChrysalis seized the doctor in her magic. "Liar!" she shouted at him. "Don't patronize me! They're wrong! I know they are!" She threw the doctor through the door and out of the room before abandoning the disguise and returning to her natural form. "Zecora, you witch!" she screamed. "What have you done to me?!""

changelings_paxchrysalia.418.d:0 "In the dead of night, Carrot Top was still awake, stargazing. Beyond her garden, over the rooftops of Ponyville, the night sky was on the prowl.\n\nJust weeks ago, the Everfree had swept into Ponyville like a tidal wave, ousting the changeling garrison in a deluge of rampaging foliage. Even after the worst of the forest had receded, some of its denizens had stayed behind, settling down amidst neighbourhoods overgrown with exotic vegetation.\n\nNow, timberwolves stalked the streets, occasionally getting into fights with the bugbear who'd made its den in the ruins of the town hall. Lurking in the gutted interiors of houses were carnivorous parasprites or star-spiders, or worse, a nest of cockatrices. Then there was the ursa major, mother to a dozen ursa cubs, all of whom still lived within the Everfree proper but had made the recently-afforested Ponyville part of their hunting grounds. It was the monolithic, star-speckled bulk of the mother bear that now towered above the canopy, the cosmos within its ethereal body blending into the night sky.\n\nCarrot Top watched as it meandered off into the outskirts of the town. She wondered how the urban topography had been transformed in the wake of the ursa major's incursion. At daybreak, she would set out to the farmers' market — the new one, in the shell of Barnyard Bargains — and sell her carrots to the few ponies who still called Ponyville home.\n\nIt wouldn't be an easy journey. She'd first have to detour around the Pear family farm, where a platoon of changeling infantry had holed up, left behind during the panicked flight of the Heer. Sometimes, when she felt especially brave, she'd creep as near as she'd dared. She'd eavesdrop on the stranded changelings, listening to them bicker amongst themselves, crying out for their frigid northern homeland. Something in the ambient magic that now saturated the air stopped them from shapeshifting.\n\nPonyville was not a no mare's land. Some of the beasts who roamed the streets could not be cowed by any pony, not even the fighters of the zebra Zecora; an expedition into the town by the forest-dwelling partisans had ended in a one-sided slaughter in the middle of town, where they'd provoked the bugbear. Cut off from the rest of Equestria, there were still those loyal to the Harmonic Resistance, harbouring dreams of a Ponyville restored to its former glory as the bastion of Friendship; between them and Zecora's partisans there existed an uneasy truce. Neither side laid claim to the vacant Castle of Friendship, though it was the only structure in town untouched by the forest. Some of its windows were wide open, beckoning to the foolhardy.\n\nMost of Ponyville's extant population lived on a single street sealed off from the rest of town by barricades, guarded by wary ponies wielding shotguns and pitchforks. Walls had been knocked down to create thoroughfares through rows of houses, a family in each room. In a basement, there was a school that provided an improvised education for the foals in the community. Carrot Top preferred the seclusion of her carrot farm, but she was happy to do business with the survivors. They were her friends, and her deliveries of carrots, though infrequent, were her way of showing that she still cared for her erstwhile neighbours."

An especially pencil-necked changeling under his ministry had finished a long-overdue report on the Everfree Forest's properties with an absurd yarn that was obviously covering for a bad job until the Minister started checking the work. What it said was pretty dangerous if true, and it seemed to be, but it was bad enough to be out of his department.\n\nThat was weeks ago. Now, he stared agape at his orders to build a custom thaumato-nuclear device within a year in relation to that report. What was going on? Why was such a weapon needed?\n\nHundreds of miles away, in Vevilsburg, Captain Dieter emotionlessly read his orders to take over one of Marsilio's minor projects to create a kind of changeling-specialty magical weapon, specifically a defoliant, and start stockpiling it to an absurd level. He picked up the phone and called Vevilsburg's basement level 5.\n\nHive's Marshall Trimmel was grinning at his own set of orders. She wanted HOW MANY heavy bombers? About as many as they should have already had, in his mind! And with more than enough money to make it happen! It seems his next great campaign would be against nature.\n\nIn Canterlot, Jachs was baffled by his orders. An entire army around the Everfree, tons and tons of bizarre herbicides, and a magical superweapon, and he had a year to build the infrastructure for all of it before an entire damn forest attacked? The Everfree was a known mystery, an enigma upon a pyramid of questions. Now he was told that it was going to do something probably bad and definitely big in about a year. Could it even be beaten? He only hoped that whatever preparations he was making, it would be enough."

One was Alcippe, and the other two were Economic Minister Finicus and Research Minister Marsilio, on a planned visit from Vesalipolis. "I trust that you were well-received?" He asked. He knew the answer, of course, since he had put Alcippe on the case, but it was polite.\n\nMarsilio started annoyedly. "Our guards were highly disruptive to maintain security, and the car's bomb-proofing made it uncomfortable, but any trip where nobody shoots at you is a good one." He flashed a grin to punctuate the joke. Finicus merely shrugged. "Of course, we are here on business and lunch took longer than expected, so we shouldn't dawdle."\n\nJachs replied, "Agreed. I am told that you both have proposals, alongside just being here as part of your new duties."\n\nIt was Finicus's turn to speak. "Yes. I wish to run a survey. Ponies on the streets. White-collar convicts. Low-level offenders. Normal ponies. I want to see their minds work so that I can figure out how to value them."\n\nIt seemed oddly restrained for the famously callous changeling, but that was a good thing. Jachs said, "I can arrange that. And you?"\n\nMarsilio said, "I've been told to "expand" the literature on pony biology. Like, disassembling them, doing things that were illegal in Equestria. I'll need the most unmissable ponies your police have been taking under fog, the ones where you already know they're getting executed before you've even got them. Not the normal ponies." Jachs could tell that he was expecting to deal with worthless monsters, but that wasn't who the state hated the most.

Jachs and his role as Minister of Central Equestria fit that bill to the Nth degree, and the 96rd was the obvious candidate because of his past command.\n\nBest of all, under his watchful eye it had been one of the most tolerant divisions. It got citations for being too lenient or kind to locals, but now that the war was over, that kind of behavior was downright desirable. It was like that division had been built for this very job!\n\nThe unit was so freshly-reassembled that the speech he gave to explain things was only fifteen minutes long. Then, the various groups fanned out into their various retrainings, some to become Jach's own vanguard military police, some to become normal defenses, and the rest being more specialized.

It was the new Royal Guard of Equestria, recreated with a number of Changeling influences. Gone were the primitive Halberds. Now they were carrying genuine hoof-crafted Breakers. Their pure gold armor had taken the same route, and was replaced with a design that aimed to syncretize it with the Heer's style, making it a ferocious combination of blacks and golds and slight touches of red. It was an experiment, and while Jachs had liked it, the first receivers had levied many complaints, (to their officers faces no less) but they were able to be convinced otherwise.\n\nWith that squared away and new scourges ordered, the rest of the day had gone smoothly. Now all that was left was their acting Captain, a Pegasus named Second Wind who was finishing his own last test, hence why the first batch of recruits were currently barely in formation and panting like mad.\n\nFrom the squares, that Captain appeared in his all-black dress uniform and walked up to the Major-General. One of the soldiers broke formation to follow him. He was about to give her the dressing-down of a lifetime when a green fire erupted around her, leaving a changeling in her own dress uniform, complete with Lieutenant's tabs. Alcippe, seemingly unaffected by the long run, joined Second Wind besides Jachs. "He's good!" She said happily.\n\nJachs looked at the tan Pegasus in front of him, and said, "Would you like to talk inside about your new job?

Jachs responded. "I appreciate the effort, though. Call me Major-General Jachs."\n\nSecond Wind said, "I got it, sir. Major-General, Jachs...

I get that they're, well, OUR unit, and I can run it how I want, but what does that mean?"\n\nA number of papers describing commands and locations was spread out on the desk. "In short," Jachs explained, "You and your new Royal Guard is here to look like normal ponies who like us. You'll do police work, guard work, general good guy stuff, and in between, officers like yourself will be appearing in public to show your support for the decisions made by the Queen directly or through the intermediary of me."\n\nThe Captain seemed disappointed by the answer, but simply responded, "Thank you, sir, it will be an honor to work with you.""

If you wish to do so, be alone at the corner near the Terraceville Bit and Bridle at two past midnight on the night of the next new moon. We shall pick you up then.\n\n     Sincerely, the Society."\n\nJachs fell over in shock, magically grasping for the spare pistol he kept in his nightstand. He pointed it around the room frantically, clearing the closets and the hall, before realizing that whoever had put the note there was already gone. He would have to talk to his security about this. At least nobody saw his reaction.\n\nWhat was the purpose of the note? It couldn't be a trap to take him alive. Why take the risk that he might not join and instead beef up his security when the sender could do something almost as valuable for their cause with far more certainty by placing a bomb under his bed instead? No, if the sender wasn't stupid (which truthfully was a possibility), then it was a legitimate invitation.\n\nBut would he accept it? Was it worth the risk to learn more about the VOPS's secret society, and what they wanted with him specifically?"

changelings_paxchrysalia.505.d:0 ""Well this is disappointing." Jachs stood in the middle of the room. On the other end were three bloody forms, all ponies. The floor was covered in a smattering of casings for Changeling weapons.\n\nThe officer besides him said, "We didn't get shot at, and that blue one is still breathing, so I think it went okay."\n\nJachs sighed. "Yes, but I was expecting to uncover part of a grandiose secret conspiracy against our administration." The police sergeant looked at Jachs in confusion. "Here is only a few blocks away from the Terraceville Bit and Bridle."\n\nThe sergeant cocked his head. "The sex shop?"\n\n"Yeah, that one," Jachs replied. "A secret society left a note in my house telling me to go there in the middle of the night... right about now, in fact. And when I saw that this was nearby, I thought the two would be connected. Guess not." The room fell silent except for the other officers searching for evidence and trying to repair that still-alive pony's blood supply.\n\n"Fascinating. Can we go now? We had to call so many officers that the other sixteen guys are just standing around outside wishing they could be in bed like they usually are at this time of night." The officer asked flatly.\n\n"Sure, head home," Jachs answered. It really would have been convenient if his theory had been true, but it was a shot in the dark. Now he had a much more conventional and much more obnoxious task of trying to stem the tide of drugs into the city. It was a crucial job, too, since the Harmonic Resistance was much nicer to fight than any of the groups who would supplement their cash flow with drug selling.\n\n"Death to drug dealers" signs were about to become a lucrative business."

changelings_paxchrysalia.506.t:0 "Dabbling in the Esoteric"
changelings_paxchrysalia.506.d:0 "Major-General Jachs stood uncomfortably in the most inconspicuous fine clothes he had. He was at the corner just outside the Terraceville Bit and Bridle, and according to his watch, two past midnight was fast approaching. The city was unexpectedly silent at this hour, and in the light of the streetlamp, he couldn't even see Team Meteor, the best soldiers his division ever produced, watching from nearby windows. All he could clearly make out was himself standing alone in the cold… lightly-armed, unarmored, and nervous.\n\nThe purr of a quality (no, luxury) engine reached his ears, but he could see no car down the dead streets surrounding him. When the sound was very nearly on top of him, he shuffled uncomfortably before seeing the interior of a car appear on the road before him. But only the interior – besides the door-shaped look into some sort of limousine's passenger cabin, there was nothing but empty air, or at least that's how it looked to him. The cabin in question was empty, as far as he could see, and he prodded at the backside of the door to it, which was clearly physical, yet the exterior side covered up the interior with a glassy lens through to the world behind it. He looked vaguely in the direction of one of the Team Meteor posts and as conspicuously as possible didn't make the sign for "Start shooting and help me" before getting into the car and disappearing from sight.\n\nWhen he sat down, he found himself in an opulent vehicle. It had interior lighting, the softest cushions he'd ever seen, gold and red velvet trim, and portal-windows on every side with views into a dimension that was as a city-sized art museum, filled with statues and paintings and all other fine and ancient mediums. He felt the car accelerate, causing a double-size replica of The Castle Spice-Alchemists to fall behind along with the bust of Prince Konig. The fact that those were the first things outside the portal-windows was probably why this place was chosen, Jachs thought."

changelings_paxchrysalia.1506.t:0 "The Cornucopia Society"
changelings_paxchrysalia.1506.d:0 ""Where are we going?" Jachs asked. The car hadn't been moving for long, and yet he was already nervous. There was a solid panel separating his cabin from the driver, and whoever was on the other side gave no response. Jachs was already regretting this decision, and the fact that he was alone wasn't helping. At least the car was obeying the speed limit, giving him time to distract himself by looking at the artwork outside, much of which he hadn't seen. Then again, this visual dimension was an art collection.\n\nAfter some amount of time of hoping he hadn't just gotten himself killed, despite the classiness of this organization implying otherwise, the car stopped. The door opened itself again, and after not getting shot in the head by some sort of assailant, Jachs stepped out into an abandoned car park. The door closed behind him, and the car drove away before he could attempt to see the driver. The car park was a large hallway, with trash in the corners and stains from water on the walls. It smelled like a dirty air vent. The only landmark, besides the path behind him, was the steel door to a closet of some sort. \n\nJachs got close and looked into the slit. The other side opened up to reveal two amethyst eyes staring directly into his own. "Governor Jachs," a sultry voice said, "We've been expecting you." The door unlocked and swung upon. He found himself pulled inside of another decadent room, filled with sofas to recline on, and strung-out ponies barely conscious upon them or gathered around tables with vials of glowing blue liquid. Not ponies, unicorns. There was a dubious fog coating the ceiling that swirled and writhed, emanating from who-knows-where. The door slammed shut behind him, causing him to freeze in place briefly.\n\nHis hostess was a unicorn as well, white with a long and well-maintained purple mane. She wore a masquerade piece that covered up most of her face in feathers and porcelain. He decided to hazard a guess."

changelings_paxchrysalia.2506.d:0 "The hostess stared at him blankly, before ignoring the suggestion entirely. "Welcome, Governor, to the Cornucopia Society. You may call me Gloriosa."\n\n"Pleased to meet you, Gloriosa." Jachs replied. "This doesn't seem like your common drug den. Why are you all unicorns?"\n\n"There's no need to be so so direct, dear. Nobody here is in the military." Gloriosa replied as she wandered into the deeper rooms of the complex, always looking behind to make sure Jachs was still following her. "That's the point. We're unicorns. The crème de la crème of Canterlot, who used to run the entire nation as the Princess's loyal nobility."\n\nJachs suddenly flashed back to dozens of times when erstwhile political theorists had embarrassed themselves before him with some tale of arbitrary superiority. This one seemed to at least be eloquent. "And that means getting high in a parking garage?" He remarked. The unicorns down here, splayed out and giggling or mumbling or moaning, were hardly as noble as a Changeling Queen.\n\n"Don't be so crude, Governor." Gloriosa asked with feigned offense. "Your kind wanted escape, too, when life was grim. Hence the parades, the banners, all that. Still some of you want to escape the machinations of your own mind, which I'm sure you can attest to." He said nothing. "You aren't alone. We were never meant to be ruled by another race, much less another species. So unicorns spend a night or two here, seeing visions of the world as it should be." The masked hostess took an empty seat in the corner, the better to see the addicts. Jachs sat beside her.\n\n"And where do I factor into this?" Jachs asked.\n\n"Always with the questions," Gloriosa dismissed. "Just because you don't have the right eyes doesn't mean you can't just relax and enjoy luxury for a bit." She gestured to the blue vials on their table. "They're on the house. Or you can just take the time to think the normal way about why things are all askew.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.3506.d:0 "He took a moment to look around. All these ponies, of every shape and color. Each taking what time they could to relive the past to dodge the present, in which they were slaves in their own nation, toiling day and night for the benefit of their mortal enemies. Jachs would never wish to relive his own past. He would never feel nostalgia for the hunger pangs, the worry that some minor illness would end him or one of his loved ones, the indignity of denying his parents a proper burial so that his siblings could get even one extra meal, the parade of his fellow's corpses he saw as he made his way across Equestria, the endless letters that some niece or nephew or friend or brother had been bayonetted, disintegrated, perforated, eviscerated, died screaming and bleeding after being maimed by one of these furred THINGS. He wished like nothing that he could take pleasure from these damnable creatures suffering as he had suffered, but all he was left with was a cold desire to see them all cast into a pit of fire so that he could hear them cry out in pain himself, and then never have to think about them again.\n\nBut it wouldn't accomplish anything, as he had learned from experience. So he buried the feeling once more. He wasn't at all surprised that, in the distance, he saw a familiar white unicorn with a grey mane, tired and unkempt, nearly catatonic on another set of cushions.\n\n"I understand." He said flatly, relaxing his muscles from their tensed-up state.\n\n"I knew you would." Gloriosa purred, and lifted a vial. "But you want to hear what I can offer you, I can tell. This concoction is love, concentrated love, refined in ways your kind has never dreamed of. Try some, and this can be the start of us both fixing our worlds."\n\nJachs looked grimly at her. "And if I refuse, and hunt you and your addicts to the end of the world, you will fight back until the bitter end, I'm guessing."\n\nShe smiled. "Would you have it any other way?""

He hesitated, not having any idea what he would find. Would he ever regret missing out on that part of officer school again? He thought not. Gloriosa lifted another vial in hers, unscrewed the cap, and downed it all at once. Jachs followed suit, in spite of the sickeningly sweet taste, and an equally overpowering confectionery stench. Seconds passed. "You've made the right choice, Governor," Gloriosa said as his vision began to blur.\n\n"What can I expect?"\n\n"We've never given this to a changeling before."\n\nA purple haze crept into his vision, flooding his compound eyes slowly. As it overwhelmed him, he could make out bright lines of deep purple coursing through his limbs, his body, his face, eventually feeling it over his whole body. In Gloriosa he saw the same, as bright red lines traced her blood vessels in his vision. Then, the world simply was a haze of magenta and violet.\n\nWhen his vision began to make out shapes again, he found himself before two doors. Both of them were murky, only being vague frames with interiors and handles. In this realm of the mind, there was no need for definition, as he already knew what everything was. One door was purple, the other red.\n\nJachs soon found himself staring at them idly, before feeling a compulsion to open one of them."

changelings_paxchrysalia.5506.d:0 "As soon as he touched the handle of the red door, he found himself in the streets of Canterlot once more. It was a sunny day out, and he was wearing no uniform. Across the street was a small group of ponies walking about. He remembered, as if it had happened, that a few years ago the Changeling Lands had demanded a very conditional servitude of the Equestrian state, and the Princesses, not wanting to suffer the war brought on by the massive Changeling army, accepted. Now, there was peace in both nations, as the changelings did only what they were allowed to under threat of execution by the Queen and the ponies were left mostly in charge of their homeland.\n\nJachs smiled. There was no war, and yet the days of hunger were over.\n\nHe turned across the table to his brother, Jantra. He rarely saw Jantra outside of his Vhy uniform, but here he was. Jachs remembered that, with the cooling of relations, he had gone the same way, and the two could now be on friendly terms again. In the distance, he heard a changeling (one of his cousins who had died in the war) giving his compliments to the owner of the restaurant.\n\n"So how's retirement, war hero?" Jantra joked. Jachs had left the army once it started shrinking to collect his pension. He never saw a single battle.\n\n"It's great. I get to live here, learning the customs and handling the integration. It's rewarding enough that I think I would've come here and done it for free." He breathed the fresh, unpolluted air. There was no hint of industrial encroachment or the suppressed malice of his own Canterlot.\n\nHis brother replied with a chuckle, "Are you really thinking of going native?"\n\n"No, I just like the peacefulness of here. But ponies do love to tolerate, so raising kids wouldn't be too bad…" He thought out loud. He had a house here, it was in a good location…\n\nEven if for just an hour, a minute, a second, or however long it was, Jachs felt happy. In the back of his mind, he wished he would never leave."

changelings_paxchrysalia.6506.d:0 "Jachs's eyes opened slowly. His head hurt, and there was a noise that kept him from being able to think a complete sentence. The world was blurry, and he barely held his balance as he stood up. At least the fog inside of him was vanishing quickly enough that he could feel it. He regretted to leave his rest until he figured out that he had been buried in a dumpster.\n\nIn front of him was a telephone booth that he recognized. Shaking off the trash as he went, he shuffled inside and propped himself against the wall as he picked up the phone. He was somewhat conscious that it ringing was what had woken him up. "Lieutenant Alcippe?" He asked groggily.\n\n"Yes!" Bellowed the voice of his erstwhile assistant, or what sounded like it. "Jachs, what the hell is going on? You left me a weird note, and you snuck out of your house and we couldn't find you, and now it's early in the morning and you're in uptown and we don't know ANYTHING about what you've been doing!" Good, he thought, Team Meteor hadn't said a word.\n\n"Give me a bit. I need to clean up, and I'll swing by the office and tell you what happened." He claimed. He already had a story involving a late-night rush to help out an old friend, the likes of which had sensitive details he wouldn't talk about, just that it could have gone badly, and it didn't. He did have concerns about slurring his way through it if this after-effect didn't go away fast enough.\n\n"Damnit, Jachs, you can't do this kind of thing anymore, alright? We were worried sick for you. Major-General, I can't do your job!" The voice pleaded over the speaker. \n\n"And here I thought it was because you liked me as a person." Jachs joked back. The silence on the other side of the line was overpowering both the drugged haze and his lingering tinnitus. He bit his tongue and continued, "Right. I'm sorry for making you worry, Alcippe, but sometimes you just have to do what you have to do.""

Well, it seems that you can lead a bug to culture but you can't make them think." He could hear her reaching for a weapon from under the table.\n\n"Oh, I understand the favor." He stated as he walked away. "That's why I'll find it in my heart to spend the rest of the night sleeping before I tell the guys in grey about this operation of yours. But really, I simply can't allow this kind of business to happen in my city, I'm sure you understand." The masked unicorn laughed to herself as he passed through the piles of barely-alive unicorns that coated the floor.\n\nIn a short while, he was above-ground again in the cool, empty night air. It was a real shame, but a group like that was too dangerous. Bringing someone else's secret society into your own fold would be a recipe for political disaster. Besides, every changeling knew that drugs were for Thoraxians and other smelly unfortunates. Now if only he had a way to get a team of assault cops together at this hour… Oh well, at least he was being kept honest.\n\nThe next morning, as promised, he oversaw an operation to raid a place he had seen a lot of suspicious activity around during a late-night walk. Besides a few pieces of detritus, leftover furniture and empty vials and the like, there was nothing there. But the organization did get an interesting look into a certain group called the Cornucopia Society, enough for their intelligence officers to sink their teeth into."

You do not know who you are dealing with." Dieter insisted.\n\nJachs didn't have to take this. "Dieter, your Undercaptain Carnara is very worried about you. No one would think less of you for going to any of the state-organized anti-addiction facilities. I'd recommend you take advantage of that. I've seen what you put in your body." Jachs insisted back.\n\nDieter paused. Then he said with a hint of pleading, "Jachs, that stuff is the only way I can sleep at night without nightmares."\n\nJachs sat in his chair and turned to his paperwork. "That's fine, but I don't want to hear about what I should and shouldn't do about that group when you are working with them for less worthwhile reasons than me. I won't try and step on your wings on that, and you won't step on mine about this. Right?"\n\nDieter said nothing. He just turned the thought over, nodded, and went to leave the room. Jachs called out to him, though. "Is your ideal world really just a good night's rest?"\n\nDieter explained, "No. It's done that ever since the first time, when it gave me a vision of being shot in the head."\n\n"I see," Jachs said."

"I thought it was a joke," Octavia replied, jumping out of the bed sans instrument case. "The government doesn't exactly like me. Something to do with making my opinions known on the slavery, the police state, the exploitation, et cetera. So what are you trying to hire me for?"\n\n"There's a major event coming up at the Canterlot Castle. It's a ways off, but I want to secure the best cellist in Equestria as a surprise." Jachs lied. "What are your prices for this sort of work? I am willing to pay a rather large sum... or maybe you don't want money."\n\nOctavia thought, and thought, and thought, and then smirked. "My price is the release of the Friendship and Harmony Forever Ensemble"\n\nJachs raised an eyebrow. "Really? The ones who got jailed for interrupting Queen Helvia’s birthday? Well, there are easier ways to say that I should look elsewhere."\n\nThe cellist leaned back. "Oh, you're going to do it. Because ever since 1002, I've been remembering that I was slated to play at Princess Cadence's wedding, and I was struck by how that same Princess showed up to every single practice I did no matter what. Since that wasn't Cadence, I'm guessing that Chrysalis called for me by name. So yes, you will do as I say."\n\nJach's raised eyebrow lowered into a scowl. "Okay. Have a nice evening."

The beach wind blew the granules of sulphur into the roiling water, and Queen Helvia and the audience took a moment to sit in silence. After all, they were threatening to boil an entire ocean if it didn't cooperate. They couldn't be seen looking anything less than serious. Then, once the last of the fine powder blew off the pier, it was over, and the crowd began to disperse. The nation was, for another year, protected from freak storms or rogue waves, come to send unfortunate sailors to an inglorious burial, or to wash over the city bearing naught but inarticulate destruction.\n\nJachs was one of the spectators in a hurry to leave. Vanhoover's salty air and numerous canals always made him uncomfortable, but more importantly, he was just plain busy.

He asked.\n\n"Indeed. It was a good birthday present that this went off without any rogue bards interrupting like last time." Helvia replied dismissively. Jachs tried to hide his bracing for impact. "Funny thing, their behavior would have had them shot that same day if they were changelings in Ditrysium. But you argued that I should spare them, and they received life imprisonment instead. Recently, I heard that even that was apparently too dramatic for you, and their sentence was commuted after not a full year. Would you care to explain that?"\n\n"It was the cost of the services of a very valuable non-government contractor, I'll have you know." Jachs said.\n\n"Are you out of money?"

It was an important thing since he had to make sure that the workers weren't distracted by the massive screaming protest mob being barely held back by dozens of Second Wind's new Royal Guard. An explosion screamed the death knell of an outwork, soon to be replaced with a concrete fortification, as was the entirety of the outermost layer of the structure.\n\nYes, much of the School for Gifted Unicorns was being destroyed, and it was predictably unpopular. Jachs had never seen such a large protest, although he had seen plenty of riots. With the amount of bricks nearby, the line was currently easy to cross.\n\nThe reason for this was that the colossal collection of Arcana which the School had, and that it included a lot of objects which were basically immovable. Naturally, the labcoats said those were the best parts. So it was either tear up a piece of priceless Equestrian heritage, or leave much of the most valuable knowledge out of reach, and the Queen, in her infinite wisdom, chose the former.\n\nJachs had done all he could to ease the obligatory re-opening, but much of the artifacts were part of the curriculum, either as learning aids or as learning tools. The School would likely never reach its former glory again, especially considering the Royal habit of hoarding interesting things in reliquaries forever. The place where some of the greatest mages in history had taught and learned was being consigned to history by his own signature. Sometimes, that was just how his job was.\n\nHe looked over to see Second Wind himself, making sure his troops were in line. One of the protestors had spit in his face, and he was wiping it off.

A cadre of bodyguards had been assigned to protect the Queen during the parade, chosen from the most capable of the collaborators and defectors to emphasize how much the Queen was beloved by Equestria. And to top things off, Second Wind and his Canterlot Guard would be the honor guard for the occasion.\n\nShe tucked the checklist back into her pockets and hummed to herself as she went along. Everything was going smoothly. It was time for the changelings to finally claim vengeance for the Canterlot Defeat of 1002. That day had hardly been perfect, but this one would be.\n\nShe was sure of it. "

changelings_paxchrysalia.513.d:0 ""After the Queen's procession through the city, she will take to the podium here at the Royal Palace, where she will watch the rest of the parade," Generalmajor Jachs said, tracing the parade path with his hoof. The other generals of the Heer's High Command, along with ranking officials from the Queen's Guard, watched with rapt attention. "First we'll start with regiments of the Queen's Guard, who will end their march by filling out the plaza around our queen. Once the image of her stalwart protection is assembled, then we'll proceed with the Jaegers from the Heer, and the accompanying armor regiments. Then, Hivesmarschall Trimmel will give a speech, and Chrysalis will be crowned Empress Regnant of Canterlot and Equestria, and give her own speech. Cue fanfare from Octavia Melody, cheering, a thunderous flyover, and that's a wrap. Any questions?"\n\nThe changeling generals shook their heads and murmured their agreements — save one. "What about the POWs, Generalmajor?" Dieter Heinrich asked. "You know Her Majesty would love to see those filthy wretches squirm in their chains before her. It would be the icing on the cake."\n\nJachs frowned. "The POWs would go before the tanks," he said. "The imagery of the defeated being driven before our metal monsters that broke Equestria would be sufficient to please the Queen, I hope."\n\n"Certainly," Dieter agreed with a smug smile. "And it'll give the rest of us something to feel proud of as well. I can't wait to see it done."\n\nThe changelings broke soon after that, the officers going their separate ways to prepare for the upcoming coronation, leaving Jachs behind with the parade plans. He frowned at his notes as he thought about the POW march. Octavia had begged him to call it off... but could he still do that? Could he still make that change last minute? But perhaps the better question was... should he?\n\nThe Pax Chrysalia had been nothing short of humiliation and atrocity for the ponies of Equestria. The changeling boot had never been so heavy or so firm on their necks as of late. Marching the once-proud Equestrian soldiers through Canterlot as emaciated prisoners of war would be the final insult to a defeated populace.\n\nCould the Pax Chrysalia survive one last insult from the changeling occupiers?"

changelings_paxchrysalia.514.d:0 "Oberstleutnant Alcippe reviewed the parade order as the soldiers got set to march through Canterlot before their queen. Everybody had checked in so far, from the zealots of the Queen's Guard to the pony collaborationists of the Canterlot Guard, save for one key entry. Alcippe frowned when she realized that Second Wind hadn't checked in for command of his division, and it wasn't like the Canterlot Guard could march without their commanding officer. Perhaps something had come up that was keeping him? It would be wise to go check.\n\nAlcippe passed off the checklist to a Leutnant and snatched a small portable radio to take with her. "Make sure the parade begins on time," she ordered the Leutnant as she set off. "Nothing gets off schedule." Then, confident that her oversight wouldn't be missed, she set off through the barracks, looking for Second Wind.\n\nShe looked high and low, but the pegasus was nowhere to be found. He wasn't at his quarters or in his office, and she didn't see him in the yard within the compound or in the skies above. Frowning, Alcippe was about to return to the staging area when she noticed the heavy door to the prison block was slightly ajar. Curious, the changeling dragged the door open and slipped inside. "Kommandant?" she asked, hearing some noise from up ahead. "Are you there?"\n\nShe rounded a corner and came to a stop. There in front of her were two ponies, Second Wind and a mare by the name of Bluebelle arrested a few days ago for plotting with the resistance. Second Wind had what looked like a bomb jacket around his chest, and the Bluebelle had just finished fixing it onto him. All three looked at each other in shock before the room burst into a flurry of frenzied activity.\n\nBluebelle reached for her gun, lying on the table behind her, and Alcippe drew her own and fired off several quick shots before she could react. The bullets killed the partisan instantly, but in that split second, Second Wind dove through a nearby window, disappearing out into the open sky. Alcippe cursed, knowing she could never catch the pegasus on wing, and reached for her radio."

changelings_paxchrysalia.515.d:0 "The parade was about to start, but Jachs still had enough time for a quick lunch. Knowing that marching on an empty stomach and then reviewing the troops for hours wasn't exactly the smartest idea, the Generalmajor took a much needed lunch break as his calm before the storm moment to prepare himself for the march to come. But even that wasn't spared the demands of responsibility, as a pair of soldiers hurriedly rushed into his office after a perfunctory-sounding knock on the door.\n\n"The Queen herself better be in danger or something," Jachs grumbled, setting his sandwich aside. "What is it?"\n\n"A pony turned herself in, claiming that she had something urgent she needed to talk to you about," one of the guards said. "She claims that she is, or was, a member of the resistance... It's Octavia Melody, sir."\n\nThe name struck Jachs like a slap to the face. "Octavia?" he asked, incredulous. Then he stood up, his lunch forgotten. "Take me to her. Now."\n\nMinutes later, he entered an interrogation room, where Octavia was seated at the bare table. She looked disheveled, and much the worse for wear. He didn't even wait for the door to shut behind him before he started asking questions. "Right now, I don't care if you're part of the resistance or not. What did you need to tell me."\n\nOctavia looked at Jachs and nodded. "A splinter cell of the resistance in Canterlot wants to assassinate Queen Chrysalis," the mare said. "Despite the wishes of the rest of the resistance, the radicals are moving forward with a plot to bomb her during the parade. Your own Canterlot Guard captain is going to deliver the bomb himself."\n\nJachs blinked in shock. "Second Wind? You... how do you know this? And why tell me?"\n\n"That's none of your business," Octavia said, shaking her head. "What is important is that the status quo in Canterlot is tolerable for ponies, thanks in large part to your efforts, but blowing up the changeling queen will do nothing but make things worse. Forget reprisals; if the Queen's Guard gets to avenge their queen, nothing short of genocide will come to Canterlot." She leaned across the table. "Do whatever you want with me, but you have to stop it, for all of our sakes."\n\nJachs stomped his hoof and cursed. "I'll take care of it," he said, sharply turning about and heading for the door. "And you, get back out there and get ready to play, like we agreed on!""

changelings_paxchrysalia.516.d:0 "Jachs had teams of Jaegers fanning across Canterlot in minutes, searching desperately for the runaway Second Wind and the bomb meant for the Queen. Jachs himself had taken wind, abandoning the early stages of the procession. He would have stopped the parade entirely, but Queen Chrysalis had already set out in her motorcade, and he didn't think she'd stop even if he told her what was about to happen. All that would accomplish would be a waste of precious time, so now his only hope was to find Second Wind before it was too late.\n\nAs luck would have it, Jachs spotted a figure flitting into the top of a nearby bell tower out of the corner of his eye, and he immediately changed course. He swooped into the top of the tower and drew his sidearm in the same motion, aligning the pegasus in his sights. "Second Wind!" Jachs shouted, making the pegasus jump and turn around. The two soldiers locked eyes in their standoff, on opposite ends of the tower, with only a large brass bell hanging above to separate them. "Don't do this," Jachs urged him. "Whatever you think you're trying to accomplish, you're not going to succeed."\n\nSecond Wind visibly shook as he offered a retort. "The changelings have had their boot on the neck of ponykind for too long!" he shouted back, rage and agony filling his voice. "You marched in and took everything from us, and when that wasn't enough, you turned us to slaves! Windbreak, a mare I knew from the Royal Guard and a hero in her own right, is some bug general's personal slave for her to play with as she pleases! Your vicious queen's selfish conquest and disdain for my entire species has brought misery to Equestria like never before!"\n\nHe touched his hoof to the bomb vest securely fastened around his body. "I'm going to stop it," he shouted, his voice cracking with anguish. "I don't care what happens to me, but she needs to die. She needs to die if Equestria is to live."

changelings_paxchrysalia.517.d:0 "Jachs risked a step further, and when Second Wind didn't flinch back, he took another, then another. He'd closed half the space between them before he thought of what to say. "You will only make things worse for ponies in Equestria, Second Wind," Jachs said. "Queen Chrysalis is too self-absorbed to ever look at what's happening beneath her in the chain of command. She has cruel whims and flights of fancy, but show her something else to distract her from it, and she can be dissuaded out of those ideas." He gestured to the street below, where the procession was approaching the bell tower. "Remember when I told you to make the best of what we have? To work within the system we have and try to make what small changes we can? I used my authority as governor to cancel the POW parade. It would be nothing short of humiliating and degrading for ponies across all of Equestria, I know. So I used the authority I have as governor of Canterlot to put an end to it. I didn't go protesting to the Queen that this would violate pony rights or cause more trouble than it was worth. I'll catch flak from it when this is all said and done. But I had the right and the means to make a difference using my station. Not every change has to come through violent revolution."\n\nHe took a few steps closer, and placed his hoof on Second Wind's shoulder. "Killing Chrysalis will lead to nothing short of cruel and harsh reprisals from the Queen's Guard. They will not be so easily distracted, and they will put every waking moment toward exacting vengeance upon ponykind. We can't let that happen; Chrysalis has to live. And together, we can use our postings to keep the worst of her impulses away from hurting your kind."\n\nTears streamed down Second Wind's face, and finally, after what felt like an eternity, he hung his head. "You're right," he whimpered. "I'm just so... so angry... the world shouldn't be this cruel."\n\n"It shouldn't," Jachs agreed. "And we can do our parts to make it less so. Now come on. Let's get this thing off of you and get you back into the parade. If we're quick, it will be like nothing happened.""

He didn't know if he'd be able to stop Second Wind at the belltower, but he was glad that the pegasus finally saw reason. And when Second Wind led the Canterlot Guard in procession in front of Queen Chrysalis, it was impossible to tell that the stallion had a bomb meant for the Queen strapped to himself just minutes before.\n\nThe rest of the parade was a blur to the worn-out changeling. Soldiers marched, tanks rolled, and planes roared overhead as the changeling high command each took their turns giving speeches. Jachs, as Governor of Canterlot, had to give his own speech, and when the time came, he stepped up to the podium and pulled out a couple of folded note cards from inside of his jacket. Then, clearing his voice, he spoke to the assembled changelings and ponies, his voice booming around the plaza.\n\n"Citizens of Canterlot, soldiers of the Heer, and everybody else that has honored us with their presence here today," he began, eyes scanning the crowd. "It has been a difficult journey to get to where we stand today. We have had to make hard choices. We have had to make risky choices. We fought hard to conquer Equestria, and we fought even harder to keep it. But we have. Today, our Great Queen shall be given her rightful crown, and a Queen shall become an Empress. But today would not be possible without the hard work of everybody, pony and changeling alike, that have come together to make the Pax Chrysalia a lasting peace. We may still have much work to do, and we may still be faced with threats both inside and out, but there is one thing that I know for certain: that we have overcome our darkest times, pony and changeling alike, and now, together, we can work to make brighter times in the days ahead."\n\nThen he turned to face Queen Chrysalis and deeply bowed. "All hail Empress Chrysalis, the true keeper of the Pax Chrysalia!"\n\nThunderous applause greeted Chrysalis, and Jachs stepped aside to let the Queen be granted her new crown. And as the Queen lifted it off its satin pillow in her magic, all the world knew that the defeat of 1002 had finally, finally been avenged."

The adrenaline rush of his last-minute confrontation with Second Wind before the parade had long since left him, and being present for everything Empress Chrysalis wanted in the hours that followed had left him drained. He wanted nothing more than to crawl into bed and sleep, but the full moon was out over a cloudless night, and he felt compelled to spend a few moments admiring the sleepy city before retiring for the night.\n\nHe wasn't the only one, he realized, as he stepped out onto the balcony. Alcippe, Marsilio, and Finicus were there, talking quietly as they admired the night sky, but what surprised Jachs was that Second Wind was there as well. Their chatter stopped when they heard the door open, though smiles greeted him when he shut the door behind him. "Enjoying the night?" he asked the three changelings (and one pegasus).\n\n"It's nice to have some peace and quiet," Alcippe said, and then she glanced aside at Second Wind, who lowered his head. "And we were just talking with Second Wind. He told us about what happened."\n\n"It's in the past, now," Marsilio said. "And what happened doesn't need to leave this balcony. It's for everyone's best interests."\n\n"Though blowing up Chrysalis would have been pretty funny," Finicus said with a snicker. But then he shook his head. "I'm just kidding. It's good that everything worked out the way it did. It's the best outcome for all of us."\n\nJachs nodded as he took a seat at the edge of the group. "It's been a long journey to get here, but I'm happy it's finished with," he said, leaning back against the wall and looking up at the stars above. "Somehow, we did it, and that's all any of us could ask for. And so long as we keep doing our best, then we can make things a little better, step by step."\n\n"It's all any of us can hope for," Second Wind said.

"Those are my comrades, my brothers and sisters in arms, paraded before your whole despicable army like livestock, humiliated and broken! There isn't any justice in this!

Bits traded hooves for exotic Love elixirs, and the wealthy paid extra for private rooms and personal attendants while they submerged themselves in bliss for a few hours. All of it served to make the Society stronger, and Gloriosa herself ever more powerful.\n\nShe sipped on her own cocktail, the sweet aftertaste of Love lingering on the back of her tongue. Her arrangement with the changelings had let her put trusted unicorns in many civilian positions throughout the city. She'd even started placing unicorns in the lower echelons of the occupying garrison, and she had no doubt that the money and product she could move would see them rise in due time. Thanks to her efforts, paired with the resources of the Society, unicorns were finally reaching their rightful place at the top of the pony pyramid. Canterlot would be a shining beacon of unicorn supremacy, and soon, she'd extend her efforts to the neighboring provinces and states. Anything was possible with the Society's resources and the partnership with the changelings. Maybe one day, she wouldn't even need to work with the changelings anymore. Maybe soon the unicorns would climb up the next step and put the changelings beneath their hooves, as was only right. Unicorns deserved to rule all, after all.

The chaos would have given the Society the opening it needed to seize control of Canterlot, but with the Queen's survival, all of her hopes had been dashed. And as the changelings gunned down the last of her collaborators in her new makeshift den, she knew that the Society was finished.\n\nShe finally stopped many miles away by the river that flowed past Canterlot. Her limbs were shaking from exhaustion, but she'd managed to flee her pursuers. But she knew they wouldn't stop looking for her. So long as she lived, she was a threat to the Hegemony. She'd have to try to flee the country if she could, or at the very least, go into hiding in some no name town, and wait for her time to come again.\n\nShe pried her mask off and held it in front of her. Not a pony nor a changeling knew what she looked like under the mask; Gloriosa was the mask, not the mare. In this case, her true self would be her greatest disguise.

The changelings conquered us, and here I am licking their boots just so I can get exempt from the Love tax and provide better for my family. What is wrong with me?"\n\n"Nothing," Second Wind assured her. "You're doing what you have to do. And look at it this way, Private." He stood up and gestured at the map of Canterlot hanging on the wall by their side. "Who would you rather be patrolling the streets of Canterlot: us, or bug soldiers fresh in from Vesalipolis? Who's likely to treat ponies fairly and with respect: us, or bug soldiers fresh in from Vesalipolis? Who's likely to make a difference under their watch: us, or...?"\n\n"...Bug soldiers from Vesalipolis," Parsnip said, finishing Second Wind's sentence. "I... I think I understand what you mean. Things can be better under us than under the bugs." She even managed a small smile. "Thank you, Kommandant. I guess I really needed to hear that."\n\nSecond Wind nodded. "Anytime, Private. And if any of your companions are having similar thoughts, tell them to come to me. Us ponies have to stick together, you know?""

She was filled with questions that needed answers, but those answers were hard to pin down.\n\nThankfully, she spotted Jachs coming out onto the balcony for his evening drink, as he usually did, and she went over to him. "Alcippe," Jachs said, accompanying the informal greeting with a slight nod. "How are you holding up?"\n\n"To be honest? Pretty poorly," Alcippe admitted. "I've been doing a lot of thinking ever since Second Wind's... you know." She sighed. "What we're doing... I don't think it's right."\n\nJachs raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"\n\n"Everything," Alcippe sighed in frustration. "A lot of what we've been doing is just... wrong! And Second Wind trying to assassinate the Queen really made me open my eyes. To the ponies, we're the villains of this story, Jachs. And in spite of all that we've done to keep the Queen's Guard in line..." She swallowed.

"I understand where you're coming from, Alcippe," he said at last, setting his drink aside and turning to face her. "And I've had my fair share of those thoughts ever since the end of the war. I think it all comes down to..." Jachs paused, searching for the right words. "I suppose it depends on what you feel is the most meaningful way you want to go about effecting change. I could resign my commission right now and go join the Thoraxians — or, well, what's left of them. But the higher ups would just promote another officer to take my place, and looking at the way the Queen's Guard has been snatching up all the leadership positions with any real power... Well, suffice to say that it's unlikely my successor will share my inclination towards sensible policy-making. From a rational point of view, the best thing I could do for the ponies right now would be to stick it out in the Heer, and make sure that the worst impulses of our colleagues remain in check."\n\n"But that's not how morality works," Alcippe said, shaking her head. "Just because we're being easier on POWs doesn't mean that we aren't responsible for their suffering in the first place. The little acts of kindness and mercy don't outweigh the bad that we've done."\n\n"And you're right," Jachs agreed. "We have benefited greatly from an unjust status quo. And in enforcing the Pax Chrysalia, we are complicit in upholding that status quo. But big changes can be brought about by small steps. Our actions today will inform those carried out by the officers of tomorrow, and they will learn from our example. And the generation after that will learn from them. Little by little, we're making a difference in the best way we possibly can. But change can't happen immediately, and it can't be done by one changeling alone. Do you understand what I'm saying?"\n\n"I... I think," Alcippe said, hesitantly nodding.\n\n"Good," Jachs said, and he patted her on the back. "It's not immediately gratifying, I know. And it's not easy to live with all these burdens on our conscience. But if we work together... well, maybe one day, future generations will judge us by all the good we've done, alongside the bad.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.528.d:0 "For once, the hectic responsibilities of being both a Generalmajor in the Royal Heer and the governor of Canterlot and central Equestria had given Jachs a break, and the stars had aligned to give him a free weekend off. For once, Equestria wasn't on the verge of total revolt, and that allowed Jachs and his staff a chance to breathe. So, thinking to do something fun and relaxing, he invited Alcippe over to his residence to watch some old Equestrian films from before the war.\n\nAlcippe arrived shortly after eight in the evening, in a plain and reserved dress that made her look like just another changeling going about her day. Jachs smiled as he welcomed her inside, and he took the offered bottle of wine in his magic and popped the cork. Then, pouring two glasses, he followed Alcippe into his living room, where he already had his personal projector set up and loaded with film. Alcippe sat down on one end of the couch, looking at the stack of films set next to the projector. "How much digging did you have to do to find contraband like this?" she asked as Jachs started up the projector.\n\n"Less than you'd think, but more than you'd hope," Jachs said with a coy smile. "But I know a few ponies who were willing to help me out."\n\n"And how much trouble would we get in if VOPS found out?" Alcippe asked, a mischievous twinkle in her eye.\n\n"Plenty," Jachs said. "But I bet Vaspier watches the same films in his free time, so we'll be fine."\n\nAlcippe giggled, and soon the speakers began to play the opening music of the film. Taking a sip of wine, Alcippe slid across the couch until she was by Jachs' side, leaning her weight against his shoulder. Jachs responded by draping his wing over her back, and wrapping them up in a nearby blanket. The two changelings smiled, rubbed noses, and happily turned their attention back to the screen, happy to finally have some time together that wasn't consumed by the weight of their responsibilities."

It's a miracle their kind has lasted this long, truth be told."\n\n"It's a miracle you're still on this board, you freakin' idiot," Finicus growled. Then he stood up and put his hooves on the table. "What sort of crap have you been huffing? Have you seriously been lapping up the garbage the Empress and her cronies feed you? If ponies were so bad at, well, everything, as you seem to believe, then the war wouldn't have lasted as long as it did or been so costly. Truth is, the ponies are good at a lot of things. And the ponies that have gears and machines on their butts? They're better than the average drone at almost anything you could throw at them in this factory. Why wouldn't we want to hire them?"\n\n"But... sir..."\n\n"Go," Finicus said, glaring at the changeling and pointing to the door. "You're not welcome in this company anymore. And if my rank as CEO and president doesn't get you to step down, I'll ask Generalmajor Jachs or maybe the Empress herself to deal with you. I've got a lot of influence now, so I'd watch it if I were you." Sighing he looked at the rest of the board. "Well, if a pony's merits don't sell you on this idea, think of it this way. We can be the first to get qualified pony technicians into our factories. Do you understand the marketing appeal of that? Do you understand how much more efficient our workforce could be with a few well-placed pony technicians working for us? You thought the money we made during the war was a lot? Well, you have no idea what you're in for when we outcompete our competitors and get a monopoly on industrial production! So come on, sounds like a good deal, eh?""

Now, he and his longtime friend and partner, Dr. Spectrograph, had busied themselves with the newest question that could change the world: how to create artificial Love that was just as potent as the real thing. "I'm glad to hear that," Marsilio said, ripping the report out of the machine once the printing was finished. He held it up and frowned at it. "Huh... take a look at this."\n\nDr. Spectrograph removed the wires taped to his body and hopped off the table, walking around to where Marsilio stood. His eyes glided over the lines and numbers, and then he whistled. "Thirty-seven percent comparable? That's more than double what we had a week ago! At this rate, we should have an acceptable substitute in a few more months!"\n\n"Well, I wouldn't go quite that far," Marsilio said. "We'll likely plateau out at some point when we hit a snag. But yes, it is promising. If our artificial Love has a third of the potency of real Love, then we're really getting somewhere."\n\nDr. Spectrograph shook his head in amazement. "It's amazing to think their may be a day soon in the future where changelings won't have to forcibly take Love from us ponies. Who knows what sorts of cooperation could happen then when that day comes?"\n\n"I can't imagine," Marsilio said, but he turned and smirked at Spectrograph.

For many, it was their first time in Canterlot, and for all of them, it would be their first lecture from a senior officer. For Alcippe, it was her first time giving such a lecture. She'd petitioned Jachs to reorganize the curriculum in the officer schools, and somehow, the Generalmajor had found the right strings to pull to make it happen. Now, any would-be officers that were set to receive assignments somewhere in Equestria or Olenia would go through schooling at Canterlot, not Vesalipolis, and that would let Alcippe impart what she wanted to on them.\n\nThe clock in the academy buzzed at the top of the hour, and Alcippe straightened her posture and cleared her throat. "Good morning, cadets. Welcome to your first lesson of officer schooling. My name is Oberstleutnant Alcippe, and I report directly to Generalmajor Jachs himself. And today, we will be teaching you about something that you absolutely must keep in your mind at all times if you are to be an officer in the Heer: respect."\n\nShe advanced the slide projected against the wall, revealing a series of pictures: one of Empress Chrysalis at the top, another of Generalmajor Jachs on the left, and a third featuring a unicorn, an earth pony, and a pegasus standing side by side by side. "Respect is what the officer's corps is built upon. First and foremost, respect to our Empress, for she is the one who brought the hives to glory. Second, respect to your superiors, for the chain of command must always be upheld. And lastly, respect to the ponies of Equestria. This was their country not too long ago, and most are still resentful about our occupation. They have a right to be resentful; I would be too if things were the other way around."\n\nShe looked out into the crowd, making note of which faces were paying the most attention; she knew those cadets would be the ones she could count on in the future. "We are conquerors. But that doesn't mean we need to be oppressors. For the Pax Chrysalia to be upheld, we must be respectful to our subjects. We must respect their rights. We must respect their concerns. And we must respect their culture. Because if we don't, then we are not the righteous changelings we believe ourselves to be. We are nothing more than criminals.

changelings_paxchrysalia.532.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs applied his signature to the last form on his desk and dropped it into his outgoing mail to be sorted and sent that evening. It'd been a busy day in Canterlot, a busy day full of new and exciting changes for the future. Piece by piece, bit by bit, Jachs used his authority as governor of the Canterlot Commissariat to push through reforms that would make life just a little more tolerable for the ponies living under the changeling boot. And with the recent round of reforms, he felt he was making good progress. When he had first come to Canterlot, ponies cried out in dismay under the brutal oppression they found themselves suffering under. Now, the boot had come off of their necks, and in its place, a helpful hoof had been extended to guide them into the future.\n\nThere was one last item on his desk, however. It was a parcel, concealed under the stack of missives to be drafted and signed, and Jachs pulled it over with a curious quirk of his brow. Unwrapping the parcel, he found a book wrapped in a plain brown dust jacket, and nothing else. Opening the cover, his eyes immediately set on a hoofwritten note from Second Wind, scrawled across the corner of the page:\n\n"Jachs, you've done so much for the ponies of Canterlot. You've done so much for me. Some might even call it friendship. Take a look at this book and tell me if you agree.\n-Second Wind"\n\nJachs turned the page, and he gasped at the title. "Twilight Sparkle's Journal of Friendship?" he murmured to himself. That was impossible; all the surviving copies of the journal had been the first thing thrown into the fires as the changelings settled into their occupation of Equestria. To have a surviving copy in his hooves...\n\nJachs closed the book and shivered. In his hooves was the most illegal book in all of the Hegemony. Surely, he'd be executed if VOPS found out he had this. It would be safer to destroy it.\n\nBut then again...\n\nSmiling, Jachs opened a locked drawer on his desk and slipped it inside with the rest of his keepsakes, gathered over years of service to the Heer and the Canterlot Commissariat. Getting rid of such a powerful book would be foolish. And maybe, just maybe, one day he'd be able to openly read it and discuss it with his friends."

Talk instead turned to what was going on in everyling's personal lives, and how they were making the best of their opportunities in the Pax Chrysalia to enjoy themselves in their downtime. It made for an easygoing, relaxed dinner, and when dinner was finished, the four changelings took their drinks outside and sat on Jachs' porch overlooking his spacious backyard.\n\nFrom there, socially lubricated by alcohol as they all were, talk continued to less-remembered topics, and Finicus, of course, was the one who brought it up. "Hey, Jachs, remember that time we got high as kites in Gloriosa's drug den?" he asked.

Word is that the armaments procurement branch of Mayfly Electronics is trying to create magitech exoskeletons that could let one of our jaegers go toe to toe with a griffon knight. I also know that the university in Soryth plans on using genetic engineering and psychological conditioning to raise a generation of designer grubs. But I've got something even better in mind: Cutie Marks."\n\nAlcippe snorted and shook her head. "I think you're doing too much hard Love," she said. "That's just crazy. Having a cutie mark isn't going to turn a changeling into a super soldier."\n\n"Isn't it?" Finicus turned to Second Wind, who'd been quiet until now. "What do you think, Second? You're the only one here with a picture on your butt. I'd say you're the most qualified one to speak on this matter."\n\n"Well, I'm not sure about changelings with cutie marks, but the best soldiers and generals in the Equestrian army had very relevant cutie marks to their positions on the battlefield," the pegasus said. "You could train a townspony with a stack of bricks as their cutie mark to shoot well at fifty yards, but they're never going to shoot as well as somepony with a bullet and crosshairs on their flanks. Even our generals could be almost unstoppable if they had the right mark for the job."\n\n"Like General Spearhead," Jachs said, and both he and Alcippe groaned and shook their heads. "It's a good thing for the Hives that Spearhead didn't get a command until near the end of the war. She had a knack for using concentrated armor spearheads to pierce our lines and constantly threaten our flanks. The tank duel between her and Trimmel outside of Las Pegasus is the stuff of legends, and we only bested her when she lost her supply lines and couldn't get fuel to her tanks and trucks."\n\n"Sounds like nominative determinism to me," Marsilio agreed.

We need plenty of funding and assistance to get this project going, but I bet we can make it work. Besides, the ramifications of it succeeding are huge! Think of all the things that ponies are capable of but changelings aren't, just because we don't have cutie marks. Think of what it would mean if we managed to find the missing piece that would allow the changeling race to reach its full potential! Perhaps then we wouldn't have to be," and Finicus lowered his voice to a stage whisper, "the parasites that Queen Chrysalis is so keen on saying we're not."\n\n"Missing piece?" Second Wind asked. "What do you mean by that? You think cutie marks are some sort of missing piece for changelings?"\n\n"I don't know if any of you feel the same way," Finicus said, glancing at the other changelings in the room, "But I've always wondered what life would be like if I had a cutie mark like ponies do. Probably it would be a whole lot more meaningful, knowing what you're meant to do with your life. Not that being the CEO of Main Hives is even remotely a bad place in life to be, but..."\n\n"After we met Twilight in the mines," Marsilio said, "She got me thinking a lot about destiny and individuality. Ponies have it, and their marks are a huge part of that. And I've always wondered what would happen if we gave changelings cutie marks. Could we engineer individuality into the changeling species? Change our destiny? Who knows what we could accomplish if cutie marks are truly as life changing as ponykind believes them to be?"\n\nSecond Wind was taken aback by that, though one thing in particular stuck out. "Twilight? As in, Twilight Sparkle? She's in the mines beneath Canterlot?"\n\n"It's a long story," Jachs said, "and I'll tell you about it some other time. The important thing is that we need to keep it a secret." He turned to Finicus and the rest of his changeling friends. "But I have to admit... it's an interesting idea. I wonder if having cutie marks would mean not needing to consume Love as much as we do now, or even not at all. Could we change changeling society for the better, just by giving our people cutie marks? Do you think it could work?"\n\n"I think it could," Finicus said, nodding. He glanced aside at Marsilio. "What about you, mister scientist? Any ideas?"\n\nMarsilio shrugged. "I suppose it's improbable, but by no means impossible. I do think we might have leaped to conclusions as to what having cutie marks would truly mean for us changelings... but why not? I'd like to believe there's something inherently magical and life-altering about cutie marks. And if we pool our resources together, well, we might be able to find something out.""

"The beauty is in the simplicity, obviously. Who needs to spend millions doing cutting-edge genetic or cybernetic research, when we can use the natural bounty of the world around us to slap a picture on our flanks and enhance our natural talents twentyfold?"\n\nQueen's Guard captain Dieter Heinrich frowned as they rounded a corner and continued along the brick path meandering through the gardens. "Cutie marks are a symbol of ponykind," he said. "Why would we want to sully changeling perfection by plastering them on our chitin? We would be admitting ponies have an advantage which changelings lack."\n\nFinicus rolled his eyes. "And sticking mechanical arms onto our soldiers and turning them into robot soldiers doesn't 'sully changeling perfection'? Please." He trotted out in front of Dieter and turned around to walk backwards so the two could talk face to face while they walked. "You're a soldier, Dieter, and I know you've fought ponies with cutie marks that made them just the biggest pains in your flanks. The right cutie mark can turn the average pony into something like a super soldier in their own right. But giving our soldiers cutie marks wouldn't just make them better fighters, it'd make them better infiltrators."\n\n"Better infiltrators?" Dieter asked. "How so?"\n\n"You know how the Equestrians used to sniff out changelings in disguise by making them act out the special talent related to their cutie mark? Our infiltrators couldn't do those things to the same degree of skill and aptitude you'd expect from a pony with a cutie mark suited for that task, and so it gave them away to whoever was onto them. But if you gave an infiltrator a true cutie mark, and the abilities that came with it, then they could more or less perfectly perform that task, as ponies would expect. Cutie marks are what make ponies, and a changeling with one would be a lot closer to becoming the ultimate infiltrator — a picture perfect pony, so to speak."\n\nDieter thought for a moment, but eventually he nodded in agreement. "I see what you mean. Alright, fair. Main Hive will have the support of the Queen's Guard, but we expect results. Especially from a project as ambitious as this.""

Plus, if he was actually successful, the returns would be sky high. He'd never have to work a day in his life ever again. Maybe he'd give himself a cutie mark in something artistic to give him something to spend his retirement doing. He always thought getting into watercolors would be fun.\n\nAs he was about to leave the building and get lunch, however, he suddenly found his way blocked by members of the Queen's Guard and Empress Chrysalis herself.

How may this humble bug be of service today?"\n\n"I've come to observe the premises where your research is to take place," she said.

And I could think of nothing that could be more just in this world."\n\nThen she stood back up and smiled at him. "Actually, I could. If you could give me Celestia's cutie mark and her power to move the sun, you would be a true hero of the changeling species. Oh, the things I could do with that power..."

Not only that, but the cutie marks were largely consistent, in that the same mark would reappear if the subject was given another dose. The first trials on changeling volunteers had been far less successful; fleeting cutie marks would appear on the flanks or necks of a changeling for a few seconds, then fade away again. It was a start, but something more would have to be done.\n\nGiven the nature of the source of the magic, Marsilio tracked down an Everfree biologist who had moved to Canterlot following the war. Dr. Green Hoof had a humble little home next to the sprawling Canterlot parks, no doubt to be closer to the greenery she loved so much, and she had agreed to a visit from Marsilio to discuss her work. Though initially reluctant, promises of being allowed to join expedition teams into the forest to recover flora that may have survived the Heer's attempts to eradicate it and the partisans it held proved enough to get her to talk.\n\nSo it was that on a Saturday afternoon, Marsilio found himself inside Dr. Green Hoof's kitchen, sharing tea while he explained what exactly he was after. "Heart's Desire is a powerful magical agent, but it's hardly stable," he explained to the botanist. "The Heer wants to make use of its properties for our projects, but we need something to stabilize. It is my hope, and the hope of the Heer, that you would be able to provide some information to us as to any other floral agents that could be used for this purpose."\n\nGreen Hoof rubbed her chin and thought. "Well, there might be something," she said. "Granted, nopony's ever tried to use Heart's Desire for much of anything, given the debilitating side effects. But it is a member of the Incredibilis genus, and so some other plants from that genus might be what you're looking for.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.2603.a:0 ""And what other plants in the Incredibilis genus are there, doctor?""

changelings_paxchrysalia.3603.t:0 "A Couple of Plants"
changelings_paxchrysalia.3603.d:0 ""Well, first, the obvious and infamous one is Incredibilis humorous, or as you're likely to have heard it called, Poison Joke," Green Hoof said. "Getting any of the pollen on the skin or shell of a living creature causes the plant to perform 'humorous' pranks on the victim, usually playing off of their name. The effects are therefore chaotic, but not random, and in fact, one can get some reliability out of the plant. Poison Joke pollen added in small doses to anything tends to greatly exaggerate its strength; for example, adding some to a weak acid turns it into a very strong acid, and ingesting it alongside simple painkillers for a headache can leave a pony in a numb, catatonic state."\n\nMarsilio frowned. "That could prove too unpredictable," he said. "Is there something else?"\n\n"There is," Green Hoof said with a nod. "The seeds of the Incredibilis veritas, or simply known as the Seeds of Truth, have traditionally been used in the Equestrian south east as a remedy for all sorts of mental conditions and afflictions, from schizophrenia to dementia and more. How it works is mysterious, even to a trained botanist like myself, but it is believed that it brings out and reinforces the 'true being' of the person who ingests their powder. Though of course, it's not that simple; it seems most likely to simply reinforce the current state of an individual at the time of ingestion. Dementia patients that take it in a bout of madness have had their symptoms dramatically worsen, though those that take it during moments of clarity have significantly improved mental faculties. It's about the timing, you see."\n\nMarsilio nodded and smiled at the botanist. "Thank you, Doctor," he said, holding out his hoof for her to shake. "That was incredibly helpful. If I have any more botanical mysteries I need solving, I'll come straight to you."\n\n"Of course, surgeon-general," Green Hoof replied, taking his hoof. "And please, do remember what you promised me. The Everfree Forest is more dangerous than ever before, and I would love the opportunity to visit again with added security. Please do take me along the next time an expedition is mounted.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.3603.a:0 ""I will be sure to do that, Doctor.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.4603.t:0 "A Critical Decision"
changelings_paxchrysalia.4603.d:0 ""So that's what I was able to come up with," Marsilio said, closing the folder in front of him with his magic. Around the table, Jachs, Alcippe, and Finicus did the same, now that the surgeon-general's briefing was over. "Heart's Desire is the basis for what we're looking for. It has the possibility to make cutie marks appear, but it isn't stable enough to make them last. So we either need Poison Joke, which can greatly strengthen the power of the Heart's Desire serum, or the Seeds of Truth, which are supposed to be able to reinforce a creature's 'true self'. Now we need to make a decision on what to go after."\n\n"Why not just get both?" Finicus asked. "Then we could try both ways."\n\n"The plants are only found in the Everfree Forest or in small patches in the southeast," Marsilio explained. "And given the chaos in the southeast and their prevalence in the Everfree, I think we'll honestly have an easier time focusing on the forest. But that means that we'd need an armed and quick expedition to find what we need and get out, so we don't have time to go looking for blue flowers and then dig up seeds. So, since we can realistically only get one, what should we focus on?"\n\nJachs shrugged and pushed the folder away from himself. "Don't ask me," he said. "I'm useless when it comes to biology and botany."\n\n"That doesn't mean anything," Finicus said. "I'm useless too, but from what Marsilio said, it sounds pretty clear that Poison Joke is the way to go. I mean, come on, how can you argue against the plant that makes everything it touches stronger?"\n\n"But the Seeds of Truth are probably the safer candidate," Alcippe said. "I actually studied biology briefly before joining the Heer, so I'm a little bit familiar with it. The Seeds of Truth will be a safer alternative than Poison Joke. Who knows what could go wrong if that blue flower plays its tricks on us?"\n\n"We have time to think it over," Jachs said. "I'll need to organize an expedition regardless; that will take some time to organize." He nodded to his companions. "Think about this, and we'll discuss it later. Maybe then we'll have a clear path forward.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.4603.a:0 ""If you say so, Jachs.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.604.t:0 "The Truth of the Matter"
changelings_paxchrysalia.604.d:0 "Finicus sighed and rubbed his eyes as he pushed the latest report aside. He'd spent so long looking through his research and preliminary findings that his eyes were glazing over and he could hardly focus on anything anymore. So, grumbling, he stood up from his desk and walked to the other side of his personal study, where an opened bottle of cognac and a set of crystal glasses were waiting to give him the cure to his headache.\n\n"Want any?" he called over his shoulder to the other changeling in the room. Alcippe sat upside down on the plush faux leather couch at the far side of the room, with her hind legs resting against the wall and her head just above the floor, her magic holding reports in front of her face. She'd been there as long as Finicus had, and together, the two had spent many hours that evening looking over the industrialist's notes while Jachs and Marsilio were busy with other facets of their work.\n\n"Sure," she said, dropping the notes onto the floor and grunting as she reversed herself into a real sitting position. She took the offered glass in her magic and took a long sip, immediately grimacing and coughing as the cognac hit her tongue. "Cognac?! Oh, I should have asked what you had before I answered."\n\n"It's good for you; builds character," Finicus said with a smirk, sipping on his own glass. Then, sitting across from Alcippe, he looked at the pile of notes and folders fanned out around her couch. "So? Any earth shattering breakthroughs?"\n\n"Not much more than what we already suspect." Alcippe sighed and, despite her earlier distaste, took another sip from the cognac. "I don't even know if the Seeds of Truth will make cutie marks appear, honestly. It gives creatures intense hallucinations and episodes, but that seems to be about it."\n\nFinicus thought for a moment, taking another sip of cognac, and frowned. "You know... reading all those reports... I feel like I realized something.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.604.a:0 ""Oh? What is it?""

changelings_paxchrysalia.1604.t:0 "The Meaning of Life"
changelings_paxchrysalia.1604.d:0 ""I realized that... well, I don't care about a cutie mark," Finicus said. "And that's because I'm not looking for a cutie mark to be better in something. I'm looking for a cutie mark to tell me what to do with my life. I've spent almost my whole life devoted to one thing, and one thing only: making money. I didn't care how I did it, I just wanted to do it, because I thought money would give me the answer to what to do with my life. I just needed to get enough of it, and eventually I'd know what to do with it.\n\n"And now I have all this money," he continued, gesturing around them. "I have more money than I could possibly imagine as CEO and president of Main Hives. It bought this awesome house and it provides for my comforts, day in and day out. But what does it really get me? Nothing. And now that the Great War and all this disgusting death and destruction is over, of which we're all a big part of, I don't want to do this anymore. So I just... what do I want to do with my life?" He shrugged. "Maybe those seeds can help me. After all, what's the point in getting a cutie mark if I don't even know what cutie mark I'd want? I'd rather just know what I should spend the rest of my life doing, and then do it."\n\nAlcippe, though surprised at first, found herself slowly nodding along. "Yeah... I see what you mean. I never knew what I wanted to do with my life. I changed majors in college four times before I eventually dropped out and joined the army. Now I'm here serving Jachs... but sometimes it feels like that's all I am. Jachs' right hoof. And I'm happy to help him, don't get me wrong... but if Jachs retired tomorrow, I don't know what I'd do. I don't know what'd make me happy. Sometimes I wish there was just someone I could ask to tell me, some way to figure out what I should be doing with my life..."\n\nThe two changelings slowly made eye contact, and in that moment, a decision was made. "Screw the cutie marks and all this crap," Finicus said. "The Seeds of Truth will give us what we want. Life's bigger than a little picture on your butt. It's what you do with it, not what you're good at.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.1604.a:0 ""Let's just hope our friends will understand.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.2604.t:0 "The Meeting"
changelings_paxchrysalia.2604.d:0 "Alcippe was nervous as Jachs and Marsilio sat down into their seats, joining her and Finicus at the meeting. Jachs, rubbing his eyes after another late night of work, wasted little time opening the discussion. "Right. So, Marsilio was just informed last night by one of his buddies in Vesalipolis that the Queen's Guard somehow heard about our efforts to stabilize Heart's Desire with Poison Joke extract to give changelings cutie marks, and now they're pushing their own research into the stuff. Someling from VOPS probably tipped them off; I still haven't been able to figure out who in our staff was put there by Vaspier and who wasn't, and I likely never will. But now that the Queen's Guard and, by extension, Empress Chrysalis know that Heart's Desire and Poison Joke is supposed to be a very powerful combination to give ponies cutie marks, that's what they want us to push for. So that's what we're looking at now. Alcippe and Finicus, do you two have a good argument for the Seeds of Truth? I know you two were doing lots of research into that."\n\nAlcippe and Finicus looked at each other, and Finicus took the initiative. "Well, that's the funny thing, isn't it? Alcippe and I had some interesting discussions the other night and we thought... well, screw the cutie marks. The Seeds of Truth aren't going to give changelings cutie marks, but they can be used to give whomever ingests them vivid hallucinations, or put in other words, epiphanies. If you combine that with Heart's Desire... well, I think a changeling could figure out the meaning of life... or at least THEIR life. And that's more important than any picture on a changeling's flank, we feel."\n\nJachs and Marsilio glanced at each other as if they weren't sure what they just heard, then Jachs frowned at them. "You want to give up on giving changelings cutie marks? You want to give up on making the greatest discovery our species has ever made or ever will make just because you can't find out what you want to do with your lives when today's over with?"\n\n"It's extremely selfish," Marsilio observed. "Well, maybe that's too harsh. But it's definitely short-sighted and impulsive. We have a chance to improve our species in untold ways. Some kind of intense drug trip isn't going to do anything for that. If you really want to dream about what to do with your life, just go to Gloriosa and ask her for her drugs. At least you won't be wasting our resources to get high.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.2604.a:0 ""It's a waste of time and resources. Poison Joke is the way to go.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.3604.t:0 "The Decision"
changelings_paxchrysalia.3604.d:0 ""Giving changelings cutie marks isn't going to make a better world," Alcippe pushed back. "You think anything we find out will leave the Queen's Guard's jurisdiction? Sure, they might let you guys get one of your own, but the average changeling isn't going to get one. They'll only give them to their best soldiers or infiltrators, and all it will do is make the chokehold of the Pax Chrysalia even tighter. You're just creating a stronger and more oppressive regime with that. At least with the Seeds of Truth, we can help our species find the individuality we so crave by showing every changeling what they really want in life, even after our society beats every 'ling's hopes and dreams out of them when they're small."\n\n"It's missing the point," Finicus agreed. "Even if we gave Chrysalis Celestia's mark, it wouldn't make her kind and compassionate, though it would certainly make her much more powerful. Our synthetic cutie marks would just become a way of giving changelings an extra talent in one thing or another, or increase their aptitude in performing specific tasks, but who they are fundamentally, the experiences and biases that make us who we are — getting all of that to change will take more than just a simple stamp on your flank. Your obsession with making cutie marks a reality is blinding you to what it's really going to do to the world, and it ain't a pretty picture."\n\nMarsilio opened his mouth to retort, but Jachs held up a hoof and stopped him. "I don't want this to devolve into a shouting match," he said. "I was up late last night and my head hurts, so I'd like us to keep it down. But more importantly than that, we're friends, and we don't need to be ripping into each other. So let's agree to make a decision here, in this room, where it's just the four of us, instead of letting it fester outside. Okay?" When everyling nodded, Jachs put his hooves down on the table. "Alright. I'm going to stay out of it. I'm not going to take sides between subordinates. The three of you, figure this out on your own."\n\nMarsilio and Finicus immediately locked eyes. Alcippe knew that neither was going to back down, and the dreadful realization dawned on her that she'd have to be the tiebreaker. So what did she want: a way to give changelingkind cutie marks? Or a way to figure out the meaning of her life?"

Though the forest had been beaten and battered by the Heer, it had not lost any of the creepiness factor, and Alcippe had trouble getting a good night's sleep, knowing that monsters she could scarcely imagine could be lurking just outside of the campsite. They'd already suffered terrible attrition in the week they'd spent camped in the forest, losing expedition members and escorts to timberwolf attacks and manticore ambushes, and now their party had lost a quarter of its size. The longer they stayed in the forest, the bigger the risk that nobody was getting out of this alive.\n\nStepping out of her tent, Alcippe made her way over to the table where Marsilio and Green Hoof had gathered around a pot of coffee, trying to get some energy going for another fruitless day of searching the Everfree for the Seeds of Truth. "I know nobody here slept well," Alcippe said as she sat down, pouring some coffee out for herself. "How much longer do you think we can go on?"\n\n"Not long at all, to tell you the truth," Marsilio said. "This place does things to your nerves. Did you hear the trees whispering last night?

"Their parent trees only grow in boggy, marshy ground, and all of the marshes in the periphery of the Everfree are dried up.

Or do we keep going until we all die?"\n\n"Screw the seeds," he muttered, tossing his empty coffee cup away. "We're not going to find anything out here.

It had cost a great deal to get this far; skirmishes with partisans were common, owing to the Heer's prior failure to subjugate the Everfree, and had exacted a great toll on the escort. Even Hauptjäger Scolytin, who had seemed so cocky and confident at the start of the venture, became increasingly subdued and serious the more soldiers he lost to the forest. So far, they'd already bled away half of their escort, and Alcippe wondered if there'd be anyling left by the time they decided to return home.\n\nThe mechanized transport she rode in along with Marsilio, Green Hoof, and Scolytin came to a sudden stop, slamming into something unseen ahead of them. "Ambush!" someling shouted from the other side of the bulletproof metal, and Alcippe could have sworn she heard someling else shout, "It's the witch!" before the gunfire started. It lasted for several minutes, slowly dying out along with its accompanying shouts, until all was eerily quiet.\n\nAlcippe, Marsilio, and Green Hoof huddled in one corner of the transport, while Scolytin grabbed his rifle and cautiously made for the door. No sooner had he opened it and peered around the corner did a bamboo pole strike him in the throat, and he fell to the ground, choking on his crushed windpipe. Another blow to the head stopped his movement, and then stripes appeared in the opened doorway, eyes seemingly aglow beneath a green mask.\n\nAlcippe reached for her pistol, but the zebra was faster, darting into the transport and bashing Alcippe's head against the wall. She heard muffled shouting between the flashes of pain, and when her vision stopped swimming, she realized she, Marsilio, and Green Hoof had been dragged out of the transport by the zebra.

"All we want... all the changelings want, rather, is to find a source of the Seeds of Truth. They're looking for a way to change their entire species, a sort of salvation of individuality. They decided that the Seeds of Truth would be better than Poison Joke, even if it may be optimistic and wishful, because they want to know their true way forward, a way to become something other than... well, this."\n\n"We're not here to attack your forest again," Marsilio tried to assure Zecora. "We gave up on that. You beat us. You beat everything the Heer had at its disposal, and we're not going to try again. We just want to harvest some of the Everfree's bounty, and if we're right, this project could be good for both changelings and ponies. It could be a way to working together in the future."\n\nZecora watched them with narrowed eyes for the longest time. "There can be no peace, until your aggressive ways cease," she said. But finally, she dug through the satchel at her side and tossed a small pouch toward Green Hoof, who caught it in her hooves. "Your honesty I wish to believe, so take your seeds and leave. But if in this forest you ever draw another breath, then it shall be the last thing you do before death."\n\nWith that, Zecora picked up her staff and slipped it under the strap of her satchel as she backed away. The bushes rustled, the trees shifted, and somewhere, a timberwolf howled. The zebra melted away into the darkness of the Everfree, and the three survivors wasted no time looking at each other, now that they had the Seeds of Truth."

"It'll at least make all the hassle we've gone through worth it."\n\nThe team spent the better part of an hour carefully collecting and catalogueing the plants, only for a roar to interrupt them. "Bugbear! West side!" a soldier shouted, and the escorts moved into position to take down the monster with heavy weapons. Hauptjäger Scolytin jogged from one side to the other, nodding at Alcippe and Marsilio. "Better hurry it up," he told them. "Where there's one bugbear, more are sure to come." Then he left to join his troops as the monster drew closer to the convoy.\n\nAlcippe and Marsilio took his warnings to heart, quickly finishing their collection of Poison Joke plants and packing them away in the transports as the anti-tank rifles of their escorts made quick work of the bugbear.

"Poison Joke, Poison Joke. I knew we'd find you sooner or later. I can't wait to get these flowers back to the lab."\n\n"Hopefully it works," Alcippe said. "It'll at least make all the hassle we've gone through worth it."\n\nThat was when the gunfire started, followed quickly by a tribal yell as pony partisans burst out of the undergrowth, firing stolen weapons at the distracted changelings. "Ambush!" a soldier cried out, only to be cut down in a hail of gunfire, and soldiers everywhere hit the dirt and grabbed their weapons to fight back. Alcippe, Green Hoof, and Marsilio were still next to the flowers when the shooting started, and realizing the danger they were in, immediately abandoned the grove and raced back to the waiting transports. Bullets whizzed past Alcippe's head, and she fired her pistol blindly into the undergrowth around them, trying to buy a little bit of breathing room with lead. But as they hopped into the back of the mechanized transport, Green Hoof tripped and fell to the ground, and Marsilio turned around to haul her into the transport. No sooner had the earth pony tumbled inside did Marsilio cry out and fall to the ground, blood blossoming under his clothing and sopping it through in seconds. "Marsilio!" Alcippe cried, stopping to try and grab her friend, only for Hauptjäger Scolytin to tackle her into the back of the transport and slam the door shut behind them. "No!" Alcippe tried, trying to go back out after him, but Scolytin pinned her to the ground and slammed his hoof against the side of the transport.\n\n"Go! Go!" he shouted to the driver, and the transport lurched seconds later as it fled the ambush. As the gunfire faded away, Alcippe could only weep and shiver on the ground, knowing that she'd left her friend behind to die... not that there was anything she could have done this deep in the Everfree to save him."

"Beautiful, isn't it?" he said with a smirk. "One little flower with untold potential."\n\n"You better be careful with that thing," Second Wind warned, having found some time in his day to attend this gathering of friends. "Every foal in Equestria's heard stories about the dangers of Poison Joke. Unlike what its name wants you to think, it's not laughing matter."\n\n"I'm surgeon-general of the Heer, one of the Hives' greatest scientist," Marsilio retorted. "Don't worry about me. I know what I'm doing."\n\n"So you think it'll really work?" Jachs asked. "Cutie marks might be within our reach?"\n\n"I've got some volunteers lined up to help us figure that out. Once we get a stable compound, we'll see what happens."\n\n"I still think we should have gone with the Seeds of Truth," Finicus said, forelegs crossed. "But it is what it is. So long as this thing actually works, I'll consider that a success, if nothing else but for the contract."\n\n"But how do you know this is actually going to help changelings as a whole?" Alcippe asked. "It sounds like the Queen's Guard is just going to use it for their own purposes, making better soldiers and infiltrators. How does that benefit the common changeling?"\n\n"It... it will, eventually," Marsilio said, waving the question away with a hoof. "Once cutie marks in the Heer and the Queen's Guard are widespread, they'll trickle down to civilian use. We'll have a massive change in changeling politics, culture, even our economy. Once the military sees how beneficial cutie marks are, it's only a matter of time before it authorizes civilian use." He picked up the glass jar, tapped it once, and smiled at the rest of his friends. "Now, I need to get to work. Discovery waits for no bug!""

changelings_paxchrysalia.608.d:0 "A few days had passed as Marsilio set about finding the perfect solution for the mixture of Heart's Desire and Poison Joke. Experimentation was performed at a rigorous and methodical approach, modifying the concentrations of each plant until an optimal solution could be formed. But it was little more than trial and error, and there was certainly a lot more error than success with each trial. Thankfully, Marsilio had all the Poison Joke he needed, and he'd even set aside a portion of the harvest to cultivate more of the plant. Given enough time, he could find the solution he needed to give changelings cutie marks.\n\nBut time was not something he had. A week after he reported the successful recovery of poison joke to VOPS and the Queen's Guard, he found a directive sitting on his desk, waiting to be read. In it was an order from Vaspier Orn Kladisium to move immediately into test subject experimentation; VOPS wanted cutie marks even more than Marsilio and Jachs did, it would seem. Though Marsilio wanted to wait, he knew that trying to tell VOPS to be patient wasn't exactly a winning proposition. So, selecting the best solution he'd been able to develop so far, Marsilio wrote a request for brave soldiers to begin volunteering for the Queen's Guard's latest clandestine program."

changelings_paxchrysalia.610.d:0 "Marsilio stared out the window of his office, watching the sun set on Canterlot once again. The last of the Poison Joke trial notes sat on a corner of his desk, tossed to the side after review. It was the same every time. Even though the cutie marks gave the test subjects what Marsilio intended, and even though they worked in the short term, some freak accident would always arise to kill the subject. Every single trial had ended in the death of the changeling, as if the universe itself was telling him that his efforts were foolhardy, as if he was messing with the natural order of the world. Maybe he was. Maybe that was why VOPS told him to stop.\n\nHe let the letter slip from his magic. The program wasn't officially cancelled, per se; rather, VOPS and the Queen's Guard had decided to reallocate almost all of its funding to other, more promising projects. But the effect was the same. The project was dead, and without the funds to continue research, Marsilio had no choice but to stop. There was no other way of explaining what had happened: he had failed.\n\nOnly now did Marsilio wake up to the blind faith that had been clouding his vision for the longest time. He and Jachs had been so sold on creating cutie marks, but not so the changeling species could profit off of it. No, no. That was just what they told themselves. What they really wanted was cutie marks of their own, as if that would help them grasp their destiny by the horns and control it like no changeling ever had before. How many changelings and ponies died to get to this memo from VOPS? How many ponies and changelings died on this fruitless endeavor? And how many more would have died if VOPS didn't cancel the project?\n\nFinally, Marsilio understood just how stupid he had been. This whole project was a fool's errand from day one. At least now he finally understood that before it consumed him too."

"Finicus?" Marsilio asked, causing the industrialist to jump in surprise. "What are you doing here?"\n\n"It sucks about the project being cancelled," Finicus said, frowning at the train. "It had so much promise. We could have done so many great things with it."\n\n"It's too dangerous," Marsilio said, shaking his head. "And we were fools for pursuing it. It's better that it's quietly put away now, for good."\n\n"How can you say that?" Finicus snapped, catching Marsilio by surprise. "After everything we went through to make this happen, to finally give changelings cutie marks... how can we just give up now? How can we give up now when our destiny is right there?!"\n\n"It isn't our destiny," Marsilio countered. "We were trying to control forces we don't understand. Nobody, not a changeling nor a pony, can know what their destiny is. Our destiny is what we choose to do with our lives, not what our lives tell us to do."\n\n"Screw that!" Finicus exclaimed. "I wanted to go with the Seeds of Truth because they would have told me what to do with my life! I feel so confused and listless, like a ship without a rudder. Those seeds could have let me make sense of this stupid world I'm living in! And yeah, we didn't get the seeds, but we got the Poison Joke. That would have been a good consolation prize, to at least choose what I want to do in my life. But now that's being scrapped, too. What am I supposed to do?!"\n\nHe lunged for Marsilio, grabbing the lapels of the surgeon-general's jacket, and pulling him in close. "You've got the stuff to make at least one more of those cutie mark potions. I know you do. Please, just please give me a cutie mark in something like water colors. I've always wanted to be an artist, but life had other plans. I was groomed for this stupid job ever since I was a grub. I didn't have a say in the matter. But now I do. Now I want to get back at life. And you can help me." He desperately smiled at Marsilio. "You'll help me, Marsilio. Right?""

Marsilio hesitated, and when Jachs looked at him, he sighed and shook his head. "It wasn't completely over. Finicus begged me to give him one of the last potions I had. He wanted a cutie mark in painting. So I... I gave it to him."\n\nJachs' eyes widened. "You what?" he asked, only to be immediately cut off as an aide rushed into the restaurant and saluted him. He held up a hoof to Marsilio and turned to the aide. "What is it?"\n\n"Generalmajor... Oberstleutnant Alcippe called me to inform you that your friend, Finicus Vesali, was found dead in his apartment in Vesalipolis." The soldier hesitated at the shock on Jachs' face, and bowed his head. "I'm... sorry, sir."\n\n"Dead," Jachs murmured to himself, and when he looked at Marsilio, he saw the horror on his friend's face. "How did he die, soldier?"\n\n"He was... found in his study, surrounded by all kinds of paintings," the soldier said. "The paints he used had trace amounts of toxic heavy metals in them. The coroner believes that the paint dripped off of the canvas of his painting and into his coffee cup, and he was poisoned." When neither Jachs or Marsilio responded to that, the soldier uncomfortably saluted once more and took a step back. "I'll... arrange travel to Vesalipolis for the funeral, sir. I'm really sorry, sir."\n\nWhen he left, Jachs and Marsilio could only look at each other in shock for the longest time, neither quite believing what the soldier had just told them."

changelings_paxchrysalia.613.d:0 "Following his confrontation with Marsilio at the train, Finicus retreated to his house in Canterlot for several days to think things over. The complete failure of the cutie mark program had devastated him. He had wanted for nothing more than to make some sort of divine intervention in his life to show him his destiny. He refused to believe he was supposed to live the rest of his life at the top of a corporation that profited off of death and destruction. At the very least, he had hoped for an excuse that could validate his desires to leave it all behind and do something different, something better, with his life. But that wasn't happening, neither through Poison Joke nor through the Seeds of Truth. He was stuck where he was, helpless  and adrift in life, and the only thing he could hang onto was the status quo.\n\nBut slowly, he saw what Marsilio had meant. Test subject after test subject died getting their cutie marks. The whole thing was little more than an attempt to play god, and they were being punished for it. Marsilio was right: his destiny was to choose what to do with his life, not what his life told him to do. And right now, he had a choice between moping because he didn't get what he wanted, or actually taking some responsibility and doing what he could as president and CEO of Main Hive Industries to make things better. Maybe when he was done making the world a better place, he could turn his efforts to bettering himself the old fashioned way. Getting a cutie mark in painting was cheating, anyway. Where was the sense of pride and accomplishment in that?\n\nTaking a deep breath, Finicus made his way into his study and began to draft a note announcing Main Hive's abandonment of the cutie mark project. And then, once the air was cleaned up about this whole awful mess, he could direct his company to something better than war and death.\n\nIt was time to change the world."

The Everfree Forest had claimed one of his oldest friends, and the world didn't even have the decency to share in his misery.\n\nThe door to his office slammed open, and Jachs jumped as Finicus shuffled inside. "Unbelievable," he growled, hooves stomping on the floor. "This whole thing is a disaster! An absolute disaster! Marsilio's food for the timberwolves, and the Heer's crawling up my ass about him dying, as if it's MY fault that their surgeon-general is dead, and not THEIR fault for not pacifying the damn forest!

I tried to tell you idiots that Poison Joke wasn't going to do anything and we should have gone for the Seeds of Truth instead—!"\n\n"Enough!"

The Everfree not being contained was my fault, I know that, and that means I killed him! If you want to say that, then just say it!"\n\nFinicus' eyes narrowed and he stepped back. "Fine, Jachs. You killed him, if that's what you want to hear. But I didn't come here to tell you that. I came here to give you the courtesy that I'm leaving for Vesalipolis, and I don't think I'll be coming back to Canterlot. I have to save my company starting at the headquarters answering to the board, and we'll see if I still have a job in a month."\n\nSilence reigned between them for several long seconds, and Finicus finally turned around and walked off.

Now please, sit down on the stool and don't touch anything."\n\nFinicus did as he was told, but he still practically vibrated with excitement. "I wonder what I'm gonna see when I take a sip," he said, staring up at the ceiling as he daydreamed. "It's not everyday someling gets to unravel the meaning of their own life."\n\n"I'll say," Marsilio grumbled; he was already regretting letting Finicus visit him in the lab while he worked on the potion. "Say, did everything go alright with the Queen's Guard?"\n\n"Hmmm? Oh, yeah, it was just like I said. Dieter and Vaspier were less than thrilled that I didn't have a way to give them their own personal butt tattoos, so they confiscated all the research and notes MHI had on the project, as well as stripped away our funding for the contract. But they didn't do anything besides that. It was like I said, a slap on the fetlock."\n\nHe hopped off of the stool and looked at the clock on the wall above Marsilio's lab bench. "I have to get going anyway, I've got to have a call with the board about this whole cutie mark kerfuffle. When do you think this'll be ready?"\n\n"A week," Marsilio said. "I spent the last two weeks doing my due diligence to see if the Seeds of Truth could work with the Heart's Desire to make cutie marks appear, and nothing stuck. Now that the Queen's Guard is off of our cases about the project, we can go ahead with our own ideas for it. That shouldn't take too long, hopefully.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.618.d:0 "Finicus could barely contain himself as Marsilio gently placed a tray full of glowing blue vials on the table. Finally, after weeks of work, he was about to know his destiny. It was like stealing fire from the gods; a sip of this potion could reveal a changeling's purpose in life beyond serving their hive. Individuality, at long last, seemed in reach.\n\n"This is all that we have," Marsilio cautioned Finicus, along with Jachs and Alcippe, who had also come to his lab to see the final result. "I took two of the seeds to try and cultivate more, but without perfectly recreating their natural boggy conditions in the Everfree, I doubt they'll grow. Everything else went into making these four potions. Hopefully, it's what we're looking for."\n\n"I don't doubt you for a second, Marsilio," Finicus said, taking one of the potions in his magical grip. He pulled off the cork and smelled an aroma that seemed equal parts walnut and cherry. "It's got a great smell, at least. So, what, just down the hatch?"\n\n"Yes," Marsillio said. "The seeds were given as a sort of stew to ponies suffering from psychotic episodes, so it should work via ingestion."\n\n"Then down the hatch it goes!" With that exclamation, Finicus put the vial to his lips and tossed his head back. The potion coated his tongue and slid down his throat like syrup, and it even had a slight fizz to it like carbonation. The rest of Finicus' friends looked on as he sat in place, waiting for something to happen... only for him to blink and frown. "So, uh... how long is this supposed to take to kick in?"\n\n"I'm not exactly sure," Marsilio said, checking his notes. "Sometimes the effects were immediate, and sometimes they took hours. I don't know which one this will be."\n\n"Hmph. Well, I don't like drinking alone." He gestured to the tray as he looked at his friends. "How about it? There's three of you, and three potions left. Are you gonna get in on this too?"\n\nJachs frowned like he wasn't sure, but Alcippe was the next to grab a vial and take a drink. She licked her lips and nodded. "Well, it's got a good taste," she said, and she turned to Marsilio. "This will really show us our destiny?"\n\n"I only hope," Marsilio admitted, taking one of the vials as well. "Might as well give it a try."\n\n"I feel like I'm back at Gloriosa's den," Jachs said, taking the last vial. "Here goes nothing."\n\nFinicus chuckled and opened his mouth to say something, but he lost his voice as the world began to sway around him. He fell out of his chair, startling his friends, as vertigo took hold, and he felt like he was going to be sick. And just when he thought he couldn't take it anymore..."

changelings_paxchrysalia.619.d:0 "Finicus awoke on an infinite expanse of bright stars. He looked around himself, but saw nothing save for the galaxies of the universe. It was as if he and infinity were all alone since the beginning of time.\n\nThen, he saw movement. Up ahead, a purple alicorn made out of starlight approached him. He cowered, afraid the pony was about to smite him down, but her horn lit and lifted his chin. "Come," she said, beckoning him onwards, and Finicus felt compelled to walk in her hoofsteps until the stars winked out and darkness shrouded him.\n\nWhen he could see again, he found himself inside a factory, the hum and clamor of machinery assaulting his ears. He moved forward, walking past machine after machine and station after station of ponies chained to their equipment, working without rest in threadbare uniforms. A stallion collapsed at his workbench, and a changeling guard stomped over and began beating the stallion with a cudgel until, beaten and bloodied, the pony forced himself back to his post. It was then that Finicus realized this was no factory, but a death camp disguised as one.\n\nHe went up the stairs off of the factory floor and pushed open the foreling's office to voice his disgust, only to stop in shock when he saw himself sitting behind the desk, the suffering of the factory blocked out by loud music, and a drink in his hoof. His reflection seemed not to notice anything going on outside, until a soldier brushed past Finicus in the doorway and entered the room. "The workers are losing steam, sir," the guard said to not-Finicus. "We'll need a fresh batch soon."\n\n"A fresh batch is coming," not-Finicus said, setting his drink aside and standing up. "Damn these lazy ponies. It's almost as if they don't want tonight's ration. Well, if they don't want it, don't give it to them. Nopony eats tonight. Maybe we'll get more out of them tomorrow."\n\nThe guard nodded and walked away, and Finicus could only watch in shock as his callous double got up and casually followed after him. He didn't even move as his double approached him, and just when he thought they were about to bump into each other, his reflection phased through him, and the world exploded into bright light."

changelings_paxchrysalia.620.d:0 "Alcippe found herself wandering through the rubble of a city, moments after having followed a purple alicorn out of a starry void into darkness. She didn't know how she ended up here, but it didn't take her too long to recognize the city as Canterlot due to its verticality. Except, this Canterlot, or what was left of it, still had the banners of the Equestrian Army and the Princesses hanging from flagpoles, the fabric scorched black from a fire that died out a short while ago. The smoke rising from the embers underneath the rubble attested to that.\n\nAlcippe shuddered as she passed pony skeleton after pony skeleton, many left in gruesome poses, and many still with charred flesh clinging to their blackened bones. She paused when she saw a larger skeleton curled up on top of a smaller one... a mother and her foal, perhaps? The sight made her sick to her stomach. All around her, countless more ponies lay dead, their bones frozen in time to highlight their last agonizing moments. And when she didn't see rifles or uniforms clinging to the corpses, she realized that these were civilians, not soldiers.\n\nBut then she heard laughter up ahead, and she tore her eyes away from the bones to buzz forward on her wings. What greeted her was a terrifying sight: she saw herself, kicking a pony's skull down charred cobbles, and she was dressed in the black of the Queen's Guard instead of her usual Heer grey. And as she watched, aghast, she saw Captain Dieter approach her, a big smile on his face, matched by the grin her double wore on hers. "Excellent use of the incendiary shells, Alcippe," Dieter congratulated her imposter. "The wind caught it just in the right way to burn the vermin from their holes. Oh, what I would have given to be able to see into the firestorm, to watch them scream in agony as their flesh boiled away."\n\n"I couldn't see it, but I heard it," Alcippe's imposter said. "It was like music to my ears. I had the guns go silent for fifteen minutes just to listen to the choir."\n\nDieter chuckled and reached into his uniform, pulling out a medal and pinning it to Alcippe's own. "I think that deserves a promotion. How does that sound, Oberst? There were too many Oberstleutnants in the army anyway."\n\nAlcippe watched in dismay as her doppelganger grinned. "My thoughts exactly, Captain Heinrich. I can't wait to give Manehattan the same treatment.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.621.d:0 "Marsilio tried in vain to find an exit to the compound he was in. There were so many hallways and so many rooms, he had no idea where to go. Whenever he stopped to ask a changeling for directions, they passed by as if he wasn't even there. He eventually gave up after the fifth try, knowing that something strange was going on. Was he a ghost? Was he dead? He didn't know, but that should have been scientifically impossible. So what was going on?\n\nA set of double doors opened, and four changelings left, with an emaciated pony between them, her legs chained together so that she struggled to take more than small steps. He thought she was a unicorn at first, until he saw the nub where her horn had been removed. He blinked in shock; removing a unicorn's horn was like taking away a changeling's ability to shapeshift. It was like removing a key part of a pony's identity. What monster would do that, when simply putting a crack into the tip of a unicorn's horn rendered all but the most basic of spells impossible for them? Curious, Marsilio turned to the side and slipped inside before the doors could close.\n\nHe immediately regretted his decision.\n\nHe had stumbled into what looked like a warehouse, and the aisles and walls were lined with stainless steel cages going from floor to ceiling, some twenty feet tall. Inside each cage was a sickly, exhausted pony, trapped in a little box without even enough room to turn around. The ones on the bottom were covered with the waste from the ones up top, and the whole place reeked of refuse and disease. The ponies were like animals packed into a slaughterhouse, and most didn't even have enough hope left to cry about their situation. Marsilio could see in their dull eyes that they'd already given up long ago.\n\nThe door opened again, and Marsilio did a double take when he saw himself walking in, escorted by other scientists and assistants. "Proper living conditions don't increase the amount of Love a pony can produce," he heard his double scold an assistant. "They'll make the same amount of Love whether they're in a cage or free on the range. Sure, the Love can be sweetened if given a proper relationship with another pony, but that would quadruple the cost of housing our food supply, and it's nothing that artificial sweeteners can't cover up during the refinement process. Industrialization, Pedipalp, that's the future of Love extraction!"\n\nMarsilio could only watch in horror and disgust as his double rounded the corner, walking out of sight behind a wall of encaged and miserable ponies."

But he could hear activity up ahead, so he doubled his pace, hoping to find someling that could explain to him what had happened.\n\n"Places, changelings, places!" he heard the director shout as he set his eyes on the stage, and Jachs stopped in his tracks; that was HIS voice. Now more curious than concerned, Jachs carefully stepped forward to get a better look at what was happening. The stage in the studio had been set to look like a picturesque Equestrian farm, and he saw the changeling actors arrange themselves for when the camera was set to roll. "Alright, Pupa, your character," Jachs' double reminded one of the changelings, and the changeling giggled in light embarrassment as she shapeshifted into a cheery-looking earth pony. Once everything was in place, Jachs watched his imposter pick up his megaphone once again. "Okay, that's good. Good! Everyling, let's make this the last take, okay? Lights, camera, action!"\n\nThe actors on the stage immediately set into their rehearsed routine, with a changeling soldier accompanying a civilian up to the front door of the farm. The soldier knocked on the door, raising his voice for the microphones to catch it. "Oh, Miss Junebug? Are you home?"\n\nThe actress disguised as the earth pony immediately opened the door and stepped outside, giving exaggerated nods to the uniformed soldier. "Oh, yessir, Mister Tarsus! Yessir! What can I getcha, sir?"\n\nThe soldier and the civilian laughed, and the pony giggled along. "Why, Miss Junebug, did you forget what today is? It's the harvest day! My friend here, Carapace, said that you forgot to give your donation today!"\n\nJunebug slapped her hoof to her head. "Oh, shucks, Mister, I keep forgettin'! Thank the Queen that I have you to remind me! How's about I give my donation right now, since you're here!"\n\n"That'll work splendidly!" Tarsus exclaimed, and the actress portraying the civilian stepped up and opened her mouth as if she was drawing Love, leaving the earth pony giggling some more as a result. The scene went on for a few more seconds before Jachs' imposter picked up his megaphone again. "And cut! That'll do perfectly, we'll fill in the voice over in post. Great work, everyling! Great work!"\n\nAs the changelings began to disperse now that filming was over, Jachs could only look on in disbelief. He went from being a soldier to a film director whitewashing the occupation?

Also on the ground around him was the rest of his friends, who were just now coming to. Jachs was the first to say something, and that was accompanied by a groan as he clutched his head. "Urgh... I really need to stop doing drugs. It's not professional."\n\nFinicus snickered and leaned back against the wall. "I get that," he said, closing his eyes for a moment. But then his memories of what he'd seen came back to him, and he nervously looked at Jachs and the rest of his friends.

I likely wouldn't have known myself the horrors of what the Pax Chrysalia truly means."\n\nFinicus thought for a moment, and then slowly, ever so slowly, a smile appeared on his face. "You know what? I think those seeds did show me my destiny."\n\nAlcippe raised a startled eyebrow. "What do you mean? You're not going to become a slave driver, are you?!"\n\n"No, no! Not that at all. What I mean is that I know what I'm going to do now. I'm going to try my hardest to make Main Hives the opposite of what I saw in that vision. I'm going to make it ethical and fair.

"I'm going to turn my lab toward finding a safer and easier way of Love collection. Maybe I'll find a way to make artificial Love as good as the real stuff. Then we wouldn't need to corral up ponies and harvest their Love on a regular basis."\n\n"I'm going to do my best to be a role model for the Heer," Alcippe said. "There shouldn't be a single officer in the army that thinks it's okay to treat ponies cruelly. We have to stop it in the upper ranks if we want that mentality to propagate into the enlisted ranks."\n\n"And I'm going to make sure that we correct the injustices of the Pax Chrysalia one by one, not hide them and pretend they don't exist," Jachs said.

The soldiers fleeing the forest had reported a marked increase in monster attacks and partisan ambushes, causing even greater casualties than the Heer had anticipated when it first created the garrisons. The increase in attacks, coupled with the extremely hostile environment, had attrited away half of the Heer's garrisons before they fell back. Even a detachment of the Queen's Guard, the bravest and most fanatical soldiers in the entire Hegemony, had fled the Everfree in chaotic retreat, claiming that the Pony of Shadows had been hunting them in the middle of the Castle of the Two Sisters, which they had been tasked with exploring.

One of the first Equestrian cities to fall before the advance of the Heer during the Great War, Acornage became the hub for Changeling military transportation and logistics, through which supplies, armaments, and soldiers were directed to whichever section of the front required them most.\n\nThe long-established Changeling presence in the city made it the prime candidate for large-scale settlement by Changeling colonisers after the war. Acornage's former Changeling Quarter soon grew to encompasses much of the entire city, and the pony population was relegated to the suburbs or inner-city ghettoes, where they still make up a majority of the city's total population. The Changeling immigrants now dwelling in the Hive-Colony mostly congregate in its downtown, where several city blocks have been demolished to make way for the construction of a massive Hive built in the style of those anchoring the Changeling metropolises of Vesalipolis, Vraks, and Ditrysium. Outside the city, Changeling settler-colonies proliferate in the countryside, some being wholly new settlements created from scratch, while others, like Alvarium, were established on the sites of Equestrian towns or villages. These peripheral colonies support the main Hive-Colony, providing food, water, resources, and workers. They are much more highly militarized as well, and while Alvarium remains in transition from military occupation into quasi-civilian colonial rule, the peripheral settler-colonies stand as the bastions of Changeling control over the region, ready to mobilize their populations of soldier-settlers to march on Alvarium should the ponies rise up in open dissent.§!"

Though originally pressured by his family to attend university and become a doctor, Jachs enlisted in the army in 996, and participated in the ill-fated attack on Canterlot in 1002 as an Unterfeldwebel, having risen through the ranks in those six short years due to acute military acumen. Jachs' company managed to find fame in the defeat as the regiment that captured the Element Bearers before they could reach the Elements of Harmony, and when the military situation following the Canterlot disaster was reassessed, Jachs found himself placed in the fast track to promotion, and had reached the rank of Oberst by the time the Great War began. \n\nThough present on or near the front lines for the majority of the war, Jachs' moment of greatness did not arrive until he was tasked with capturing Canterlot. With efficient command of the resources at his disposal, Jachs managed to seal off the narrow passes through the mountains around Canterlot, isolating the city from the rest of the Equestrian army, and approaching from all sides with veteran divisions capable of fighting in the treacherous mountains surrounding the capital. Though the campaign was long and bloody, Jachs worked closely with the Luftwaffe to chip away at the Equestrian defenses before using two Jaeger infiltrator companies to outflank and destroy the first line of Equestrian fortifications around the main road leading up the mountain and into the city. Once the road had been opened, the city fell within days. Jachs would be promoted to Generalmajor for this accomplishment, and when the war concluded, was placed in charge of the central Equestrian garrison, operating out of the place of his greatest victory.\n\nThe trials of peace, however, are a completely different beast than the horrors of war. Generalmajor Jachs has more familiarity with ponies than most of the changelings under his command, and as such sympathizes with their plight. But with the changelings' hold on the city tenuous at best, a firm hoof may be needed to maintain it. The Generalmajor now faces a true test of his morals: can he hold Canterlot without resorting to wanton violence and bloodshed?§!"

With her family's resources and access to nearly anything she desired, Alcippe flitted from interest to interest, at times overwhelmed with the possibilities ahead of her and unable to choose what to dedicate her life to. After attending university in Vesalipolis and changing majors three times, Alcippe enlisted in the Heer just in time for the Canterlot Invasion of 1002, where she participated as a hoof soldier assigned to Unterfeldwebel Jachs' company. After she and her company successfully captured the Element Bearers and brought them to Queen Chrysalis, Alcippe found herself promoted in the reorganization of the Heer following the defeat. She was given the choice between staying with Jachs' 96. Infanterie or accepting a position into the Queen's Guard, but decided to stay with her superior officer in 1002 as a member of his staff. This relationship would prove to be a fruitful one, as Oberst Jachs and Major Alcippe would successfully take Canterlot using a carefully executed strategy they developed, and when Oberst Jachs, then a Generalmajor, was assigned the task of garrisoning and holding Canterlot, he tapped Alcippe to come with him as his second in command. Alcippe, now an Oberstleutnant and a great admirer of her superior officer, finds herself tasked with executing Generalmajor Jachs' decisions throughout the entirety of central Equestria. The rigors of the Pax Chrysalia will put her convictions to the test, and she looks to Jachs to steer them both right as they navigate the tough task of maintaining the changelings' hold over Equestria.§!"

His family consisted of poor dockyard workers, largely ostracized from society, and Marsilio initially grew up resentful of the deer and ponies in the city who viewed his kind with deep and unflinching suspicion. Determined to make a better life for himself, Marsilio made frequent use of the city's largest library, educating himself in all manner of topics he did not otherwise have access to in the city. His efforts paid off, and he was able to attend the University of Acornage in 981, where changeling and pony scholars worked in close tandem. There, he would meet a young stallion by the name of Spectrograph, and after becoming unlikely best friends, Marsilio's worldview on ponies and deer changed. The two graduated at the top of their class, and Marsilio left Acornage to venture to Vesalipolis to further his studies with his new worldview in mind. Marsilio excelled in Vesalipolis, earning his doctorate and originally finding work along the Changeling-Olenian border as a medical doctor. He even planned on returning to Vanhoover to continue his work and provide medical treatment for changelings in the multicultural city.\n\nThat all changed following the failed Canterlot Invasion of 1002, where in the aftermath, pony riots torched much of the ethnically changeling quarters of Vanhoover, sending refugees fleeing into the Changeling Lands. Instead of returning to Vanhoover, Marsilio decided to look after the refugees fleeing into Vesalipolis, where he eventually attracted the attention of the Royal Changeling Heer due to his expertise in changeling, deer, and pony biology and anatomy. Marsilio would quickly rise through the ranks as he worked to modernize changeling love extraction, eventually becoming surgeon-general of the Royal Changeling Heer by the time Olenia became a protectorate of the Hegemony. He would eventually move his headquarters to Seaddle, right across the Luna Bay from his old home in Vanhoover, and become much more closely involved in the Pax Chrysalia with his work on love extraction. His efforts to improve love extraction to be a painless and ethical process for the Hegemony's new subjects eventually put him in contact with Generalmajor Jachs, and after finding that they share many of the same ideas on treating ponies with respect, the two changelings became fast friends. Now the two seek to do what many consider impossible: turn the Pax Chrysalia from a brutal oppression of ponies and deer to a cooperation between the hives and their fallen foes.§!"

From a young age, he was groomed to take over the sprawling corporation, a powerhouse that his father worked tirelessly to improve and expand until his death in 1005 from an automobile accident. At the young age of 26, Finicus found himself thrust into command of the Hegemony's largest producer of heavy machinery, a situation that would have broken many less competent changelings. Finicus, however, had been prepared well by his father, and immediately turned Main Hives' attention to the wars to come. By forcing out competitors, hiring all the best talent they could afford, and filing thousands upon thousands of defensive and speculative patents, Finicus turned MHI into the greatest industrial giant in the Changeling Hives, and established its total monopoly in the area of heavy industry. Then, sensing the wars to come, Finicus made MHI practically inseparable from the Royal Changeling Heer, providing it reliable and cheap equipment in exchange for lucrative exclusive contracts. By the time the Great War started, every machine that was used to make every part of every last bit of war materiel, from the transmission of trucks to the treads of tanks to the bolts of rifles, was built and provided by Main Hive Industries to the factories that kept the war effort going. Finicus had become unfathomably personally wealthy as a result of his successful business deals, finding himself as one of the richest changelings in all of the Hegemony, yet even then, something eluded him.\n\nFinicus had never wanted to take over MHI. As a grub, he had been more interested in artistic pursuits, but those were quickly shut down by his father. Now, at the conclusion of the Great War, Finicus has captained one of the most successful companies to ever exist to untold success, yet even that has failed to satisfy him. In meeting Generalmajor Jachs, however, Finicus has found an opportunity to turn Main Hive Industry's vast resources from producing weapons of death to the tools of peace. Maybe, just maybe, Finicus will be able to find personal satisfaction in making the Pax Chrysalia a better time to live, and not a worse one.§!"

Born far above the ground in the city of Cloudsdale, Second Wind came from a long line of soldiers, dating all the way back to the genesis of Nightmare Moon almost a thousand years prior. Soldiering was in his blood, much like it is for most of the pegasus race, and he immediately enlisted with the Royal Guard upon turning 18 in 994.\n\nThe next decade would be a busy one for Second Wind. He was present in Canterlot during the infamous Canterlot Invasion of 1002, where after a brief clash with changeling soldiers on the outskirts of the city, he rallied together members of the Guard that were patrolling the perimeter at the time of the attack and organized a counterattack with the aim of retaking the royal palace. Thanks to Princess Cadance and Shining Armor, such a counterattack was unnecessary, and Second Wind's chance to prove himself came and went without him being able to seize it. Not being from a noble house like many of the unicorn members, Second Wind found his chances for a promotion slim and practically nonexistent. He seemed destined to spend his years in the service on the lower echelons looking up, where the officer corps was staffed by nobles that more often than not bought their way in using their names and familial pedigree. There was perhaps no surprise to be found there that Second Wind, born from a proud military family, had little chance of advancement when the unicorn nobility treated the organization as just another political body to dominate.\n\nThat changed during the Great War, where the mass mobilization of Equestria and the bloody fighting that followed gave Second Wind the chance he desired to prove his worth. He fought valiantly throughout the war, but even then, his long-overdue promotion only came when the fighting was all but lost and the Royal Guard was desperately looking for officers to fill its ranks. When Equestria capitulated and the new Royal and Imperial Canterlot Guard was established, Second Wind defected and became the head of the organization. Now, Second Wind watches the Pax Chrysalia be enforced on his species, himself serving as a tool to the changelings to keep his people under control. How long can a proud pegasus soldier bow to a foreign conqueror and keep his own kind in chains before something has to give?§!"

Gloriosa is the matron of the Cornucopia Society, an organization that has its roots in a long-since faded unicorn supremacy movement, but now caters to unicorns looking for a form of escapism from the tolls of the world by functioning as a drug den. Many lesser nobles are frequent visitors of the Society, operating out of the old Hotel Calihornia, and the Society has found a way to manufacture a powerful drug made from a pony's love, fashioned in a way that not even changelings have been able to perfect. It is unclear how closely the Society is or was involved in resistance activity in Canterlot before joining forces with Generalmajor Jachs, but the society is undoubtedly powerful and influential, and if Gloriosa has an interest in something happening in her city, she always finds a way to put a hoof on the scale and give it a little tip.

Before the war, love could not be reliably stored after its extraction, as it would lose its potency within minutes of being drawn from a victim. The traditional solution to this dilemma was to envelop hapless victims in cocoons, where their dreams would produce a steady and reliable source of love for a hive. However, love harvested in this manner can often be tainted by the context of the victim's dreams, and the victims could not survive being trapped in cocoons and harvested for more than a few months. Nowadays, however, the changeling industry giants have found ways to extract and contain love without it losing its potency, allowing it to be harvested from far-away towns and brought directly back to factories, where it is further refined and processed using recently rediscovered magical runes and processes to remove any unpleasant emotions that may have slipped into the love during collection. In this manner, the love that is now widely available to the hives is purer, stronger, and much cheaper to acquire than ever before.§!"
